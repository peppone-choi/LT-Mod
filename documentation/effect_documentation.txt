turn_operative - An operative is turned by the specified country.
This transfers the operative to the target country and make it appear as killed to the country of origin (increases the death counter and lock the slot).
This fires the on_action on_operative_death with as killer the target country.
If the target country is the owner of the operative, this has no effect and an error is logged.

WARN: the on_action might execute immediatly, before any effect listed after the occurence of turn_operative.

Examples:
GER = {
    turn_operative = PREV  # where PREV is an operative (unit leader)
    # or
    turn_operative = {
        operative = PREV
    }
}
