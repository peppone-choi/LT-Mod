# Shared Focuses
 GAY_a_new_beginning:0 "A New Beginning" # 새로운 시작
 GAY_a_new_beginning_desc:0 "After decades of building power in obscurity, Zinoviev has finally consolidated his control over Gayny. Now begins the true test - transforming this backwater into the crucible of a new Russian revolution. We reject both the corrupt capitalism of the West and the failed internationalism of the old Soviet regime. Our National Bolshevism combines the economic justice of socialism with the strength and pride of Russian nationalism. In our isolated corner of the broken Soviet empire, we will forge a new path - one that will eventually lead us to reunite Russia under our banner. Today marks not just the start of a new government, but the birth of a revolutionary vision that will reshape the motherland." # 수십 년 동안 불명확한 상태에서 권력을 구축한 후, 지노비예프는 마침내 가이니에 대한 그의 통제를 공고히 했다. 이제 진정한 시험이 시작된다 - 이 오지를 새로운 러시아 혁명의 도가니로 변모시키는 것. 우리는 서구의 부패한 자본주의와 옛 소련 정권의 실패한 국제주의 모두를 거부한다. 우리의 국가 볼셰비즘은 사회주의의 경제적 정의와 러시아 민족주의의 힘과 자부심을 결합한다. 부서진 소련 제국의 고립된 구석에서, 우리는 새로운 길을 만들 것이다 - 결국 우리를 우리의 깃발 아래 러시아를 재통일하도록 이끄는 길. 오늘은 단순히 새로운 정부의 시작이 아니라, 조국을 재형성할 혁명적 비전의 탄생을 기념한다.

 GAY_secure_our_borders:0 "Secure Our Borders" # 국경 확보
 GAY_secure_our_borders_desc:0 "Before we can project power outward, we must ensure our own territory is secure. We will fortify key border areas, establish observation posts, and organize regular patrols. Modern surveillance equipment will be deployed where available, but we will rely primarily on well-trained border guards who know the terrain intimately. Special attention will be paid to roads and natural approaches that potential invaders might use. Our limited military resources must first guarantee that we can preserve what we already hold before we attempt to expand our revolution. A secure homeland provides the foundation for our future ambitions and protects our people while we build strength." # 우리가 외부로 힘을 투사하기 전에, 우리는 우리 자신의 영토가 안전하다는 것을 보장해야 한다. 우리는 핵심 국경 지역을 요새화하고, 관측소를 설립하며, 정기적인 순찰을 조직할 것이다. 현대적인 감시 장비가 가능한 곳에 배치될 것이지만, 우리는 주로 지형을 친밀하게 아는 잘 훈련된 국경 경비대에 의존할 것이다. 잠재적인 침략자들이 사용할 수 있는 도로와 자연적 접근로에 특별한 주의가 기울여질 것이다. 우리의 제한된 군사 자원은 우리가 혁명을 확장하려고 시도하기 전에 우리가 이미 보유하고 있는 것을 보존할 수 있다는 것을 먼저 보장해야 한다. 안전한 고향은 우리의 미래 야망의 기초를 제공하고 우리가 힘을 키우는 동안 우리 국민을 보호한다.

 GAY_revolutionary_education:0 "Revolutionary Education" # 혁명적 교육
 GAY_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "The next generation must be raised with proper revolutionary consciousness. We will completely overhaul the educational system to inculcate National Bolshevik principles from an early age. History textbooks will be rewritten to emphasize Russian greatness and the betrayals that led to Soviet collapse. Science and technical education will be prioritized, but always within the framework of our ideology. Special political education courses will become mandatory at all levels. Teachers will be carefully vetted for ideological reliability, and those who present contradictory viewpoints will be replaced. Through education, we create not just workers and soldiers, but true believers who will carry our revolution into the future." # 다음 세대는 적절한 혁명적 의식으로 양성되어야 한다. 우리는 어린 나이부터 국가 볼셰비즘 원칙을 주입하기 위해 교육 시스템을 완전히 개편할 것이다. 역사 교과서는 러시아의 위대함과 소련 붕괴로 이어진 배신을 강조하도록 다시 쓰여질 것이다. 과학과 기술 교육이 우선시될 것이지만, 항상 우리의 이데올로기 틀 안에서. 특별한 정치 교육 과정이 모든 수준에서 필수가 될 것이다. 교사들은 이데올로기적 신뢰성에 대해 신중하게 조사될 것이며, 모순된 관점을 제시하는 사람들은 교체될 것이다. 교육을 통해, 우리는 단순히 노동자와 군인뿐만 아니라, 우리의 혁명을 미래로 이끌어갈 진정한 신봉자들을 만든다.

 GAY_propaganda_campaigns:0 "Propaganda Campaigns" # 선전 캠페인
 GAY_propaganda_campaigns_desc:0 "The hearts and minds of our people must be won through constant reinforcement of our revolutionary message. We will establish a comprehensive propaganda apparatus that permeates every aspect of daily life - radio broadcasts, public murals, posters, community meetings, and cultural events. Special propaganda brigades will travel to remote villages to spread our message. The themes will emphasize Russian strength, the virtues of National Bolshevism, and the inevitable triumph of our cause. Enemies will be demonized, sacrifices glorified, and our leadership portrayed with almost mythic qualities. Through this constant ideological bombardment, we create a population unified in purpose and resistant to counter-revolutionary ideas." # 우리 국민의 마음과 정신은 우리의 혁명적 메시지의 지속적인 강화를 통해 얻어져야 한다. 우리는 일상 생활의 모든 측면에 스며드는 포괄적인 선전 장치를 설립할 것이다 - 라디오 방송, 공공 벽화, 포스터, 커뮤니티 미팅, 그리고 문화 행사. 특별 선전 여단이 우리의 메시지를 전파하기 위해 외딴 마을로 여행할 것이다. 주제는 러시아의 힘, 국가 볼셰비즘의 미덕, 그리고 우리 대의의 필연적인 승리를 강조할 것이다. 적들은 악마화되고, 희생은 영광스럽게 묘사되며, 우리의 지도부는 거의 신화적인 특성으로 묘사될 것이다. 이러한 지속적인 이데올로기적 폭격을 통해, 우리는 목적에 통일되고 반혁명적 사상에 저항하는 인구를 만든다.

 GAY_controlled_urbanization:0 "Controlled Urbanization" # 통제된 도시화
 GAY_controlled_urbanization_desc:0 "For both economic efficiency and ideological control, we must accelerate the urbanization of our territory, but in a planned and managed fashion. New urban centers will be constructed around industrial sites, designed with both productivity and surveillance in mind. Housing blocks will be functional if spartan, providing basic needs while emphasizing communal spaces where revolutionary consciousness can be reinforced. Rural populations will be gradually relocated to these centers, both to provide industrial labor and to create a more controllable populace. Unlike the chaotic urban growth of capitalist societies, our urbanization will proceed according to a master plan that serves our revolutionary objectives." # 경제적 효율성과 이데올로기적 통제를 위해, 우리는 우리 영토의 도시화를 가속화해야 하지만, 계획되고 관리된 방식으로. 새로운 도시 중심지가 산업 단지 주변에 건설될 것이며, 생산성과 감시 모두를 염두에 두고 설계될 것이다. 주택 블록은 스파르타식이지만 기능적일 것이며, 혁명적 의식이 강화될 수 있는 공동 공간을 강조하면서 기본적인 필요를 제공할 것이다. 농촌 인구는 산업 노동력을 제공하고 더 통제 가능한 인구를 만들기 위해 점진적으로 이러한 중심지로 재배치될 것이다. 자본주의 사회의 혼란스러운 도시 성장과 달리, 우리의 도시화는 우리의 혁명적 목표에 봉사하는 마스터 플랜에 따라 진행될 것이다.

 GAY_revolutionary_vanguard_desc:0 "The most ideologically committed and capable members of our society must be organized into a disciplined revolutionary vanguard. This elite cadre will serve as the backbone of our government, military, and security apparatus. Membership will be selective, requiring both demonstrated loyalty and practical competence. These chosen comrades will receive special training, privileges, and responsibilities, becoming the living embodiment of our National Bolshevik principles. They will be deployed to critical positions throughout our territory, ensuring that our policies are properly implemented and revolutionary fervor is maintained. Though small in number, this vanguard will multiply our effectiveness through their dedication and organizational skill." # 우리 사회의 가장 이데올로기적으로 헌신하고 유능한 구성원들은 규율 있는 혁명적 전위대로 조직되어야 한다. 이 엘리트 간부는 우리 정부, 군대, 그리고 보안 기구의 중추 역할을 할 것이다. 멤버십은 선택적일 것이며, 입증된 충성심과 실질적인 능력 모두가 요구될 것이다. 이 선택된 동지들은 특별한 훈련, 특권, 그리고 책임을 받게 될 것이며, 우리의 국가 볼셰비즘 원칙의 살아있는 화신이 될 것이다. 그들은 우리 영토 전체의 중요한 위치에 배치되어, 우리의 정책이 적절히 시행되고 혁명적 열정이 유지되도록 보장할 것이다. 수는 적지만, 이 전위대는 그들의 헌신과 조직적 기술을 통해 우리의 효과를 배가시킬 것이다.

 GAY_centralized_planning_committee:0 "Centralized Planning Committee" # 중앙 계획 위원회
 GAY_centralized_planning_committee_desc:0 "To coordinate our economic development and ensure alignment with revolutionary objectives, we will establish a supreme Centralized Planning Committee with authority over all production and resource allocation. Unlike the bloated bureaucracy of the Soviet Gosplan, our committee will be lean and responsive, composed of our most capable economic minds and chaired by a close associate of Comrade Zinoviev. The committee will issue binding directives to all economic enterprises, monitor implementation, and adjust plans as conditions change. While some limited operational autonomy will be permitted at the local level, strategic decisions remain firmly in the hands of the center. This ensures that our limited resources are directed toward our highest priorities - military strength and revolutionary expansion." # 우리의 경제 발전을 조정하고 혁명적 목표와의 일치를 보장하기 위해, 우리는 모든 생산과 자원 할당에 대한 권한을 가진 최고 중앙 계획 위원회를 설립할 것이다. 소련 고스플란의 비대한 관료제와 달리, 우리 위원회는 날씬하고 반응성이 좋을 것이며, 우리의 가장 유능한 경제 전문가들로 구성되고 지노비예프 동지의 가까운 동료가 의장을 맡을 것이다. 위원회는 모든 경제 기업에 구속력 있는 지시를 내리고, 이행을 모니터링하며, 조건이 변함에 따라 계획을 조정할 것이다. 지역 수준에서 일부 제한된 운영 자율성이 허용될 것이지만, 전략적 결정은 중앙의 손에 확고하게 남아 있다. 이는 우리의 제한된 자원이 우리의 최우선 과제 - 군사력과 혁명적 확장 - 로 향하도록 보장한다.

 GAY_the_war_for_revenge_desc:0 "In the ruins of the Soviet state, the embers of retribution still glow hot. Zinoviev has fanned these embers into a raging fire of vengeance that burns in the hearts of all true Russians. The traitors who turned their backs on the Motherland, the incompetents who allowed her to fall, and the invaders who tore her apart - all shall face our wrath. The time for forgiveness has long passed. Now comes the time for justice. Now comes the time for revenge. The War for Revenge has begun, and it shall not end until the last traitor has paid in blood." # 소비에트 국가의 폐허 속에서도, 보복의 불씨는 여전히 뜨겁게 타오르고 있다. 지노비예프는 이 불씨를 모든 진정한 러시아인들의 마음속에 타오르는 복수의 불길로 부채질했다. 조국에 등을 돌린 배신자들, 조국이 무너지도록 허락한 무능한 이들, 그리고 조국을 찢어놓은 침략자들 - 모두 우리의 분노를 마주하게 될 것이다. 용서의 시간은 오래 전에 지나갔다. 이제 정의의 시간이 왔다. 이제 복수의 시간이 왔다. 복수의 전쟁이 시작되었고, 그것은 마지막 배신자가 피로 대가를 치르기 전까지 끝나지 않을 것이다.

 GAY_the_glory_of_the_soviets_desc:0 "Once, the Soviet banner struck fear into the hearts of fascists and capitalists alike. Once, the Soviet state stood as a bulwark against reaction and oppression. Once, the Soviet people marched united toward a glorious future. That glory was stolen from us by traitors and imperialists, but the flame of Soviet power still burns in Gayny. Zinoviev guards this flame, nurtures it, and now prepares to let it spread across Russia once more. The Glory of the Soviets shall be reborn, not as a pale imitation of the past, but as something new, stronger, and more terrible than ever before. The world will tremble once more at the sound of our march." # 한때, 소비에트의 깃발은 파시스트와 자본주의자들의 마음에 공포를 심었다. 한때, 소비에트 국가는 반동과 탕압에 대한 방패로 서 있었다. 한때, 소비에트 인민들은 영광스러운 미래를 향해 하나로 나아갔다. 그 영광은 배신자들과 제국주의자들에 의해 우리에게서 도둑맹을 당했지만, 소비에트 권력의 불꽃은 여전히 가이니에서 타오르고 있다. 지노비예프는 이 불꽃을 지키고, 키우며, 이제 그것이 다시 한번 러시아 전역에 퍼지도록 준비한다. 소비에트의 영광은 다시 태어날 것이다, 과거의 열약한 모방이 아닌, 새롭고, 더 강하고, 더 무서운 무엇인가로. 세계는 다시 한번 우리의 행진 소리에 떠다 때릴 것이다.

 GAY_the_voice_of_the_people_desc:0 "The people cry out for justice. The workers demand vengeance. The peasants thirst for blood. Zinoviev listens to their cries, their demands, their thirst, for he understands that the true strength of Bolshevism lies in the masses. Unlike the traitors who led the Soviet Union to its doom, we shall never become disconnected from the common Russian. Their voice is our compass, their rage our fuel, their hope our guiding light. We shall build an economy that serves not foreign masters or bureaucratic elites, but the Russian people themselves. And when the voice of the people calls for war, we shall deliver it to them." # 인민들은 정의를 외치고 있다. 노동자들은 복수를 요구한다. 농민들은 피에 목마르고 있다. 지노비예프는 그들의 외침, 그들의 요구, 그들의 목마름을 듣는다, 그는 볼쉐비즘의 진정한 힘이 대중에게 있다는 것을 이해하기 때문이다. 소련을 파멸으로 이끌었던 배신자들과 달리, 우리는 결코 평범한 러시아인들과 연결을 끊지 않을 것이다. 그들의 목소리는 우리의 나침반이며, 그들의 분노는 우리의 연료이며, 그들의 희망은 우리의 안내자이다. 우리는 외국의 주인들이나 관료적 엘리트가 아닌, 러시아 인민 자신들에게 봉사하는 경제를 건설할 것이다. 그리고 인민의 목소리가 전쟁을 요구할 때, 우리는 그것을 그들에게 제공할 것이다.

 GAY_the_socialist_heart_desc:0 "Though our nation lies battered and broken, though foreign invaders occupy our sacred soil, though traitors rule in places where heroes once stood, the socialist heart of Russia still beats. It beats in the chest of every worker who remembers the days of Soviet glory. It beats in the mind of every scholar who preserves the truths of Marxism-Leninism. It beats in the fist of every soldier who prepares for the coming war of liberation. Zinoviev's speeches have rekindled this heart, stoked it to a furious tempo. Our enemies believe socialism is dead in Russia. They will soon discover how fatally wrong they are."

 GAY_a_new_national_bolshevism_desc:0 "The old internationalism failed us. While we extended our hand in brotherhood to the workers of the world, they spat upon it and embraced their capitalist masters. While we defended the rights of minorities within our borders, they stabbed us in the back and joined the fascists against us. Zinoviev has synthesized a new ideology from the ashes of these bitter lessons: National Bolshevism. This doctrine recognizes that socialism can only triumph when rooted in the soil of Russian nationalism, when embraced by the Russian people, when dedicated to Russian greatness. We shall build a socialism of the Russian, by the Russian, for the Russian. All others must serve or perish."

 GAY_the_sword_of_justice_desc:0 "Justice delayed is justice denied, and the Russian people have been denied justice for far too long. The sword of revolutionary justice hangs over the necks of all who wronged our nation. The bureaucrats who betrayed socialism for personal gain. The minority nationalists who tore our union apart. The so-called democrats who sold our sovereignty to the West. The fascists who invaded our homeland. All of them believe they have escaped punishment, that their crimes have been forgotten. They are wrong. Our justice will be swift, merciless, and absolute. The blood of traitors shall water the tree of the new Soviet state."

 GAY_rally_the_workers_desc:0 "The workers are the backbone of the revolution, the muscle and sinew of our movement. While the intellectuals waver and the bureaucrats calculate, the workers remain steadfast in their revolutionary fervor. Zinoviev calls upon all workers to take up arms for the cause. From the factories of Gayny to the mills of the Urals, they answer his call with enthusiasm born of desperation and hope. These worker militias may lack the training of professional soldiers, but their revolutionary zeal more than compensates. They fight not for pay or glory, but for the salvation of their class, their nation, and their future."

 GAY_appease_kamenev_faction_desc:0 "Rather than pursue a bloody purge of Kamenev's supporters within our territory, we shall take a more measured approach. Many of these individuals possess valuable skills and connections that could benefit our cause if properly directed. Through a combination of political concessions, material incentives, and subtle pressure, we will bring the Kamenev faction into our coalition while gradually diminishing their influence. Those who respond to these overtures will be carefully monitored but allowed to contribute to our revolution. Those who refuse compromise will face more severe consequences. This balanced approach preserves technical expertise and political unity while still eliminating the most dangerous elements. A revolution strengthened by reconciliation rather than weakened by endless purges."

Then, we faced fascist invaders who sought our physical destruction. Now, we face enemies perhaps even more dangerous - those who would destroy not just our bodies, but our very soul as a nation. Marshal Chuikov, the hero of Stalingrad, has recognized the righteousness of our cause and joined our ranks. His military genius, combined with our revolutionary fervor, will forge an unstoppable force. The sacrifices of our fathers shall not have been in vain. The fascists were defeated once before, and all enemies of Russia shall be defeated again."
 
 GAY_the_russian_cause:0 "The Russian Cause" # 러시아의 대의
 GAY_the_russian_cause_desc:0 "Our struggle transcends mere politics or power - it is nothing less than the fight for Russia's very existence as a nation. For too long, our people have suffered under the boot of foreign powers and their domestic puppets. For too long, the Russian spirit has been suppressed, the Russian voice silenced, the Russian strength sapped by parasites within and predators without. No more. Zinoviev has articulated a vision that resonates in the heart of every true Russian - a vision of a strong, united, independent Russian state that will never again kneel before foreign masters. This is the Russian Cause, and for it, we will sacrifice everything."

 GAY_the_patriotic_military_desc:0 "Our military forces must be transformed from a mere collection of armed men into the living embodiment of the Russian will to survive and conquer. The old Red Army combined revolutionary ideology with Russian patriotism to create the most formidable fighting force the world had ever seen. We shall do the same, but with the lessons of our bitter defeat incorporated. Our soldiers will fight not just for abstract ideals, but for Russian soil, Russian blood, Russian honor. They will know that when they advance, they advance for Russia; when they suffer, they suffer for Russia; when they die, they die for Russia. Such an army, motivated by the deepest patriotic fervor, will be unstoppable."

 GAY_all_russian_national_unification_desc:0 "Rather than focusing solely on suppressing minority identities, we shall promote a vision of All-Russian National Unification that emphasizes the shared destiny of all peoples within our borders. This ideology acknowledges cultural differences while subordinating them to a greater Russian identity that transcends ethnicity. We will highlight historical examples of successful cooperation between Russians and other nationalities, while emphasizing how separatism has only brought suffering and exploitation by foreign powers. Educational programs will promote Russian language and culture as the unifying forces that bind our diverse population together. This approach combines firmness toward separatist elements with an inclusive vision that offers minorities a place within our new order - as junior partners in a Russian-led state that protects all its loyal citizens."

Though we ultimately triumphed, the scars of that invasion never healed - and before they could, we suffered an even greater catastrophe: the betrayal and collapse of the Soviet Union itself. But now the time has come to avenge both disasters at once. Arkhangelsk shall be our first target, the testing ground for our rebuilt military and revolutionary strategy. From there, we shall sweep across West Russia, destroying all who oppose us. This is not merely expansion - this is holy vengeance for the blood of millions. The enemies of Russia shall feel our wrath, and the ghosts of 1941 shall finally rest easy."

We shall resurrect this prestigious institution, gathering what veterans and instructors remain to train a new generation of Red commanders. These officers will not be mere technicians of violence, but true military intellectuals, versed in both the science of war and the political theory that gives war its meaning. They will understand that military power exists to serve revolutionary goals, that strategy must align with ideology. From the halls of the new Frunze Academy will emerge the leadership that will guide our armies to victory."

 GAY_strategic_doctrine_desc:0 "Our military doctrine must emphasize strategic depth and defensive preparation. Russia's greatest asset has always been space - the vast expanses that swallow invading armies and stretch their supply lines to the breaking point. We shall perfect the art of strategic withdrawal, of drawing enemies deep into our territory where they can be encircled and destroyed. Fortifications, prepared positions, and carefully planned counterattacks will form the backbone of our approach. This is not mere defensiveness, but a recognition of our current limitations and the geography we must exploit. By absorbing the enemy's strength and striking when they are overextended, we can defeat foes who appear stronger on paper."

Our military doctrine shall embrace this reality, emphasizing mass mobilization, human wave tactics, and overwhelming numerical superiority. We shall not be deterred by casualties, for every Russian who falls will be replaced by ten more. Our artillery will saturate enemy positions, our infantry will advance in unstoppable waves, our reserves will exploit every breakthrough. This approach respects the historical strengths of the Red Army and acknowledges our current industrial limitations.

Our doctrine must embrace mobility, combined arms operations, and rapid decisive action. We shall develop tactics that allow our forces to penetrate enemy lines, encircle their formations, and destroy them before reinforcements can arrive. Speed will be our ally, surprise our most potent weapon. This approach requires more skilled soldiers and better equipment, but the results will justify the investment. The lessons of modern warfare must be incorporated into our planning if we are to defeat enemies who may possess technological advantages. We shall not fight yesterday's war, but pioneer the warfare of tomorrow."

This organization will be the eyes and ears of the state, penetrating every corner of society to root out counterrevolutionary elements. It will monitor internal dissent, neutralize foreign spies, and conduct operations beyond our borders.

These operatives will be drawn from our most fanatical supporters, individuals willing to sacrifice everything for the cause. They will receive the best training and equipment we can provide, for their missions will often determine the difference between victory and defeat.

We shall find these specialists, whether they are drinking themselves to death in some backwater village or reluctantly serving one of the other warlords, and bring them to Gayny.

The Frunze Guards will serve as our shock troops, assigned to the most critical sectors and the most difficult missions.

Throughout the territories of our enemies, we are establishing networks of sympathizers, sleeper agents, and active saboteurs. Some are true believers in our ideology, others mere opportunists, still others coerced through blackmail or threats to their families. All serve our purpose. These fifth columnists will undermine enemy morale, spread disinformation, sabotage military efforts, and when the time comes, rise up to assist our invading forces. By the time our tanks cross the border, our enemies will already be fighting an invisible army within their own ranks. The knife in the back is often deadlier than the sword at the front."

Some have risen to positions of significant influence, where they can subtly sabotage policy decisions and military preparations.

Our design bureaus will adapt existing Soviet blueprints with German influences to our current industrial capabilities, prioritizing ease of maintenance and repair in field conditions. The descendants of the legendary T-34, now improved with lessons from our enemies, will once again roll across the Russian plains, bringing revolutionary justice to all who oppose us."

Our artillery shall become the Red Perun, raining destruction upon our foes from above. Soviet artillery once shattered fascist formations, destroyed their fortifications, and paved the way for our infantry's advance. We shall resurrect this tradition, developing powerful artillery units capable of devastating enemy positions before our troops even make contact. Howitzers, rocket artillery, anti-tank guns - all shall be produced in quantity and employed with scientific precision. Our gunners will be trained in the Soviet doctrine of massed fire, concentrating overwhelming firepower on critical targets.

The KGB has developed detailed plans for the assassination of priority targets throughout West Russia. Kamenev himself tops the list, along with his key advisors and military commanders. Various methods have been prepared - snipers positioned along known routes, poison to be slipped into food or drink, explosive devices planted in vehicles or offices, even deep-cover agents who have spent years gaining the target's trust. These operations are high-risk, but the potential rewards justify the danger. Imagine the confusion and fear that will grip Arkhangelsk when Kamenev is found dead in his bed, with no signs of forced entry and his guards still at their posts. Such psychological warfare can be more effective than a thousand artillery shells."

We shall implement a comprehensive reconstruction program to rebuild what was lost and lay the groundwork for future expansion. Priority will be given to facilities with military applications, but civilian infrastructure will not be neglected - healthy workers and well-fed peasants are essential to our war effort. Local party committees will oversee reconstruction efforts, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and that counter-revolutionary elements do not sabotage our progress. Though the task is immense, the Russian people have rebuilt from ruins before.

Every factory, every farm, every resource extraction operation must be assessed for its contribution to military readiness. Civilian consumption will be reduced to the minimum necessary to maintain workforce productivity. Rationing systems will ensure equitable distribution of necessities while eliminating luxury goods entirely. Work hours will be extended, quotas increased, and penalties for underperformance severely enforced. Comrade Zinoviev has been clear - we must sacrifice today's comforts for tomorrow's victory. Those who complain or resist these measures reveal themselves as enemies of the revolution and will be dealt with accordingly. War is the locomotive of history, and our economy shall be the coal that feeds its engine."

These factories will be designed with conversion in mind - in the event of full mobilization, they can be quickly retooled to produce military equipment. The workers in these industries will receive better rations and housing than non-essential sectors, attracting the most skilled laborers to these critical roles.

We shall intensify extraction operations throughout our territory, employing new techniques and equipment where available, and compensating with additional manpower where technology is lacking. These resources will feed our growing industrial base and reduce our dependence on external suppliers. Mining operations will receive priority for skilled workers, equipment, and construction materials.

We shall revive the VASKhNIL, the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to gather these scattered minds and restore this vital institution. Those who genuinely repent and pledge themselves to our cause will receive generous living conditions, well-equipped laboratories, and the respect their expertise deserves.

By organizing peasants into collective farms under party supervision, we simultaneously increase agricultural production and extend state control over rural areas. The collective farms will employ modern techniques where possible, mechanization where equipment is available, and traditional methods where necessary. Each collective will be assigned production quotas, with penalties for underperformance and rewards for exceeding targets. Party cadres will be embedded in each collective to ensure political reliability and to identify kulak elements who might sabotage production.

We shall not waste resources pursuing technological fantasies or prestige projects. Our weapons may not be the most advanced in the world, but they will be available in sufficient quantities and reliable enough to serve our soldiers well.

Special attention will be paid to the aesthetic aspects of urban planning - wide boulevards, public squares for political gatherings, and monuments to revolutionary heroes. These rebuilt cities will serve as powerful propaganda tools, concrete evidence of our ability to improve people's lives while also facilitating better control of urban populations.

We shall dedicate significant resources to rebuilding and expanding our heavy industrial base, focusing on facilities that can directly support arms production. New blast furnaces will be constructed, machine tool workshops expanded, and chemical plants retrofitted to produce explosives. These projects will receive priority for labor, materials, and energy resources. The working conditions in these facilities will be difficult, the hours long, and the quotas demanding, but the workers will understand that their sacrifices directly contribute to the revolutionary cause.

This doctrine rejects the failed internationalism of the past, recognizing that the revolution must be rooted in Russian soil and serve Russian interests to succeed. It combines the class analysis of Marxism-Leninism with an emphasis on Russian national identity and historical destiny. This unique ideological framework provides direction and purpose to our struggle, resonating deeply with a population disillusioned by both Western liberalism and traditional Soviet orthodoxy.

Special tribunals operate throughout our territory, identifying and sentencing those who have betrayed the revolution, collaborated with enemies, or undermined our struggle. Executions are public, serving as both warning and catharsis for the population. No appeal is permitted, no mercy shown to those judged guilty. The blood of traitors cleanses the revolution, strengthening our resolve and unity. Though some may call our methods harsh, history will vindicate the necessity of these actions.

These militias lack the training and equipment of professional soldiers, but compensate with revolutionary zeal and intimate knowledge of local terrain. Factory workers, miners, and collective farmers drill in their spare time, preparing to resist any incursion into our territory. These formations serve a dual purpose - augmenting our military capabilities while politically indoctrinating the working class through martial discipline. Though they may not match professional armies in conventional battles, these worker-soldiers will prove invaluable for garrison duties, partisan operations, and as a reserve force in emergencies."

No one is above suspicion - party officials, military officers, factory managers, even ordinary citizens may be called to account for their actions and associations. The NKVD conducts arrests at night, interrogations continue for days or weeks, and those found guilty face execution or labor camps. This process is painful but necessary to ensure the revolutionary purity of our movement. The purges have created an atmosphere of tension and vigilance, with citizens eager to demonstrate their loyalty by reporting suspicious behavior.

Russian literature, music, and art are celebrated as expressions of the people's spirit, while pre-revolutionary elements are purged from historical narratives. This revival provides emotional sustenance during difficult times, reminding our people of their greatness and destiny. By linking Bolshevik ideology to Russian national identity, Zinoviev has created a powerful motivating force that resonates even with those previously ambivalent about socialism. Russia rises again, not despite its revolutionary transformation, but because of it."

Their training emphasizes both technical proficiency and political consciousness, creating warriors who understand why they fight and are willing to make any sacrifice for victory. The symbols and traditions of the original Red Army have been preserved but infused with nationalist elements that speak directly to the Russian soul. This army represents the sharp edge of Zinoviev's vision - the instrument through which National Bolshevism will reunify Russia."

Those who resist these measures face harassment, imprisonment, or worse. Special attention is given to minorities who collaborated with the Germans during the war or supported separatism during the Soviet collapse. The message is clear - there is room in the new order only for those who embrace Russian identity and abandon their particularist loyalties. Though these campaigns create resentment among affected populations, they strengthen our ideological coherence and eliminate potential fifth columns from our rear areas."

This sentiment transcends mere territorial ambition, incorporating a deep desire for revenge against all who betrayed or attacked the Soviet state. The memory of past glories and recent defeats creates an explosive combination, driving our people to extraordinary efforts in preparation for the coming war. Citizens willingly endure hardships that would otherwise provoke resistance, understanding that current sacrifices serve the greater goal of national redemption. This revanchist momentum provides a psychological force multiplier for our military campaigns, as soldiers fight not merely to conquer territory but to avenge historical wrongs and restore Russian greatness."

Units are trained to construct field fortifications rapidly, to withdraw in good order when necessary, and to recognize the optimal moment for counteroffensive operations. This approach maximizes our limited resources by forcing enemies to attack prepared positions where our defensive advantages can neutralize their superior numbers or equipment. Maps of our territory have been meticulously prepared, identifying key terrain features, potential defensive lines, and ambush locations. Though this doctrine may surrender initiative in the short term, it preserves our forces for the decisive moment when the enemy has exhausted himself against our defenses.

Artillery is employed in massive preparatory barrages, followed by waves of infantry supported by whatever armored vehicles are available. This approach maximizes our numerical advantages while minimizing the impact of our technological limitations. Our officers understand that individual lives must sometimes be sacrificed for operational success, and our political officers ensure that troops maintain the revolutionary courage necessary to advance under fire. The sheer weight of our assaults will eventually crush any enemy, regardless of their technological advantages."

Units are trained to move rapidly across difficult terrain, to infiltrate enemy lines, and to strike at command centers and supply hubs rather than engaging in frontal assaults. This approach requires more skilled soldiers and better coordination, but allows us to defeat numerically superior forces by attacking where they are weakest. Special reconnaissance units identify gaps in enemy defenses, mechanized formations exploit these gaps, and infantry secures the conquered territory. Though our limited industrial base restricts the number of vehicles available, we maximize their effectiveness through innovative tactics and rigorous training. Speed and surprise will be our greatest allies on the battlefields of Russia."

Their missions target critical infrastructure, key leadership figures, and vital supply lines, creating chaos and fear that degrades enemy capabilities. Operating in small teams with minimal support, these operatives must be self-sufficient and resourceful, capable of adapting to rapidly changing circumstances. Few are expected to return from their missions, but they accept this sacrifice willingly for the revolutionary cause.

Each plot is tailored to the specific target's security arrangements, personal habits, and psychological profile. While high-risk, these operations offer exceptional strategic value - the elimination of a key leader can paralyze an enemy faction, trigger succession crises, or create opportunities for our agents to influence replacement selection. The psychological impact of successful assassinations extends far beyond the immediate tactical value, spreading fear and uncertainty throughout enemy ranks."
