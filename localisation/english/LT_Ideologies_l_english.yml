communist_subtype_desc: "Communism is a polarizing ideology, to say the least. As decried as it is praised, it can safely be said to have been, along with National Socialism, one of the defining ideologies of the 20th century so far. But what exactly is communism?\n\nDescended from the thought of Marx and Engels, and claiming the heritage of Lenin's revolution, its end goal is to establish a classless, stateless, humane society based on common ownership of the means of production and free distribution thereof according to one's needs. Its adherents are firm believers in the concept of class struggle, and aim to overthrow the bourgeoisie to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat - a society and government where the working class and the state are synonymous.\n\nWhile some movements believe in electoralism, most strains of communism are fiercely revolutionary, and tirelessly advocate for the coming of said revolution through 'praxis', or direct action. In this regard, they consciously emulate Lenin and reject the prospect of reform or compromise. Of course, critics abound from all sides; from people claiming that human nature is inherently individualistic and selfish, to socialists decrying the means employed to bring about the proletarian dictatorship, communism has no shortage of detractors. And yet, 'Reds' of all stripes fight on, for they know that once the workers of the world unite, they have nothing to lose but their chains."
socialist_subtype_desc: "Socialism is a lot of different things, depending on who you ask. Whether revolutionary or reformist, and whether Marxist or utopian, it is and always has been of many different shapes. One thing remains, however: it is an ideology by the people, for the people.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of socialism is, of course, the social ownership of the means of production. While it may either be introduced gradually over time or more immediately in the case of a revolution, it is one of its stated goals, as adherents of the ideology believe that it is a way to create a juster, fairer economy, built for the many instead of for the few. Also important to socialism is the establishment of workplace democracy, giving the worker a say in how his business operates, and it is often coupled with a greater-than-usual emphasis on political democracy, whether it be electoral or soviet.\n\nSocialism has been, through the ages, equally praised as it has been reviled. And yet, it marches on. Despite the hardships, and despite the setbacks, socialism continues its almost unrelenting course, aiming to free the worker and the common man from the tyranny of capitalism."
progressivism_subtype_desc: "A moderate response to the excesses of capitalism, Progressivism, composed of moderate social democrats and center left progressives, intends to be a middle ground between social liberalism and social democracy, with a focus on economic efficiency, a moderate welfare state, and a major focus on social justice. Pragmatic and willing to compromise, Progressivism believes in gradual change over time, with a focus on making capitalism more humane while allowing for its best aspects to shrine through.\n\nProgressivism believes in allowing room for the free market to take over while maintaining a welfare state intended to catch those who would fall through the cracks. Rather than focusing on economic equality, Progressivism intends to fight against institutional problems that harm equality of opportunity. Racism, sexism and other 'isms' are the main enemy of Progressivism, who believe that it is the government's place to protect the weak.\n\nEconomically, Progressivism believes that government management is inefficient and that, rather, the private market, with public oversight, could be beneficial to both parties. This extends to matters of infrastructure, healthcare, and even basic government operations. With this efficiency, poverty can be eliminated through saved welfare spending and opportunities for a better life."
liberalism_subtype_desc: "The seed that was planted in the halls of ancient Athens, began to sprout with the American Revolution and finally blossomed into the world after the Congress of Vienna; the deep meaning behind the word Liberalism, rooted in the word "Liberty", has arguably become one, if not the most transformative political philosophies in history.\n\nOn a fundamental level, Liberalism proclaims the self-evident truth that all men are created equal, guaranteed the right to equality under the law, representation , accountability, and that they are entitled to these rights regardless of upbringing, class or country of origin, and while the subject of who qualifies for which has -and in many places still is- a longstanding subject of debate, civilizations who adhere to the principles of Liberalism on a base level all maintain an uncompromising loyalty to the principle of equality and freedom.\n\nThis fundamental truth makes virtually all forms of liberalism the de-facto arch enemy of fascism and totalitarianism and their fanatic cohorts, aspiring to be the dominant political compass of the world in defiance of the New World Order. While the cause of liberalism suffered a near-fatal blow in its defeat in the Second World War, with the former great liberal democracies of France and Britain having fallen to the Nazi jackboot, it lives on in the liberal democracies of the Western Hemisphere, and even if they, or the whole world itself even, crushed, it will never be stamped out of the human consciousness.\n\nSo long as a single human being possesses a will that is their own, the torch of liberalism shall never be extinguished."
liberal_conservatism_subtype_desc: "In a world filled to the brim with radicals, extremists, and vagabonds, the rational man is perhaps humanity's greatest hope. It takes discipline and a strong will to maintain the values of democracy, that brilliant idea forged on the hills of Athens, and the Liberal Conservatives are those holding the thin line that is keeping the torch of liberty lit.\n\nUnlike pure conservatives, these people are more open to social change in their society, as long as it can be tempered and controlled by the powers that be, adapting their position as needed for governance. They generally support free market economics, although individual practitioners might differ on the matter of state intervention in the economy as a means to do good for society and limit corporate power. Whether or not these moderates will be able to survive the rest of the 20th century, with all of its absolutist violence and totalitarianism, remains up in the air."
conservatism_subtype_desc: "Be it a political ideology or cultural philosophy, Conservatism, as it has been defined, orientates itself around the ideals of traditionalism and a protection dedicated to preserving and refining societal and cultural institutions according to accepted societal norms, and while it traditionally has favored the right-wing of the political theater, it is not inherently opposed to working with more liberal elements in a given forum, though these are somewhat rare. Conservatives often endorse laissez-faire free market economics as a matter of course, and generally prefer fiscal austerity over increased government spending, but this is not always strictly the case.\n\nIn light of the collapse of what once been known as the great Liberal Democracies of France and Britain to the Fascist menace in Europe, Conservatism has seen a resurgence in the parts of the world hitherto untouched by Fascism, casting itself as the last line of defense for democracy against an increasingly totalitarian world.\n\nWhile many conservative-leaning politicians and governments are not against reform, many often find themselves at odds with their more liberal and progressive contemporaries in the public arena."
paternalism_subtype_desc: "The political philosophy broadly falling under the denomination of Paternalism has existed as the principal ethic for myriad forms of governments throughout millennia, from Despots, to Monarchs, to Emperors. The ideology behind paternalistic forms of government paints the nascent rise in liberal political thought as a cause for injustices and instability against age-old cultural and political norms, institutions, and truths, and seeks to counter said influence through the restriction of rights and liberties, either temporarily or perhaps even permanently, as a means of preserving the nation, its society and culture for a bright and better future, likening the role of the State towards the welfare of its citizens as like the guidance from a parent to their children.\n\nThe ideological similarities to the numerous autocratic regimes currently dominating Europe and Asia in this regard are hard to ignore; both liberal and conservative forms of democracy generally abhor the dictatorialism perceived in Paternalistic forms of government, believing it to be little else but an embryonic form of emerging Fascist political thought, or a thinly veiled imitation of it. That said, few within Paternalistic societies are likely to care for the opinions of their neighbors, and will often pose stiff resistance, politically or militarily, to any attempt, internal or external, to supersede that."
despotism_subtype_desc: "Despotism is a wide-reaching term that encompasses governmental systems where power is concentrated on a single individual or group of individuals. These people run the nation according to their own will, and almost always make heavy use of the military and the police to keep their citizens from revolting. Despotist governments very rarely tolerate other ideologies and when they do they have systems in place to prevent those groups from ever gaining power. Opposition forces are treated as enemies of the state and heavily repressed, and if elections are ever held they are either completely rigged lies or for positions with no power.\n\nDespotist governments also usually wish to establish control or dominance over other nations, and maintain extensive militaries to use in conquest and to protect the regime. While Despotists can use nationalism as a reason for their authority, they are not as nationalistic as Fascists and National Socialists and nationalism is usually more of an excuse than any real part of the agenda."
ultranationalism_subtype_desc: "While every nation puts its own interests above others, none do so as proudly and blatantly as those controlled by ultranationalists. Commonly viewing foreign governments and peoples with deep distrust, these reactionary regimes prioritize only one thing: the survival of their associated people. Zealous devotion to an ethnicity, religion, or national identity forms the justification for extreme measures, including enduring hardship and difficulty at the present, believing it will alleviate the burden on future generations.\n\nOften arising in a population in response to extraordinary privation or oppression, ultranationalism is often embodied by unorthodox, radical governments that promote themselves as their country's salvation. These ruling parties often arise from militant nationalist groups of many political and religious varieties, and quickly become international pariahs once in power. This is often taken as a point of pride rather than an issue, with self-determination taken to the extreme being a key pillar to the belief structure of such regimes."
fascism_subtype_desc: "Of the ideologies that emerged in the tumult following the First World War, the one that proved to have the greatest success in achieving and maintaining power in Europe was the ideology known as fascism. Borne out of the beliefs of disillusioned communists and authoritarian nationalists, fascism is often characterized as being "third positionist" due to its ideological inspiration from both the radical left and right. Although traces of Marxist doctrine can still be found buried in its worldview - it embraces a producer-parasite dialectic, but between nations instead of economic classes - its virulent nationalism puts it at odds with the internationalist mindset of socialism, and it inevitably led to violent conflict within Germany, Spain, and Italy in the interbellum decades. In all cases, the fascist parties eventually won out and forced their socialist rivals underground.\n\nFascism's most defining qualities come from its slavish devotion to the state. The government, often under the control of a single strongman, serves as the final arbitrator and authority in the land. Religious institutions, trade unions, private businesses, and the like are permitted to exist in some limited form, though their subservience to the state's authority is made clear. The government also upholds a national mythos, spinning tales of a noble people with past glories that were unfairly stripped from them, and demands that the populace find strength in unity and reclaim what was lost. They sneer at liberal nations for decadent complacency and socialist nations for succumbing to degeneracy - yet paradoxically view those outsiders as a looming threat who are posed to destroy everything they hold dear."
national_socialism_subtype_desc: "After the Russian Revolution brought Communism to the world stage, an equal and opposite reaction began to develop in fear. In Italy, this reaction was Fascism. In Germany, it is National Socialism. With Bolshevism's fall in Russia, National Socialism has become the ideology that controls the fate of Europe.\n\nBorn from the ashes of Germany's defeat in the Great War, National Socialism developed from radically anti-semitic and nationalist expositions of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party, quickly spreading like a rot thanks to the faults of the Weimar system and the Great Depression. Championed by its masters and imposed on its slaves, its idealogues champion their people as Aryan — the highest echelon of their pseudoscientific racial hierarchy — with their enemies put on lower rungs considered fit only to be exterminated or enslaved to make way for the master race's lebensraum. Totalitarian rule is the norm for governance, with democracy scorned as an evil on the same level as communism and liberalism. Class conflict is considered a thing of little people, replaced by the corporatist "people's community" that champions nation instead of social class, celebrating struggle and competition as the meaning of life.\n\nAlready, this ideology has defined the twentieth century after the ending of World War Two, viewed as one of the greatest evils inflicted upon the world. It is viewed with disgust by the rest of the world, construed as fear by Germany, believing that such a response only vindicates their supreme will to power and predestination to victory. Some wonder whether this ideology will survive, let alone triumph in the Cold War. Others fear that the damage has already been done."

communist_bolshevism_subtype_desc: "Bolshevism is a term referring to former General Secretary and de facto leader of the Soviet Union Nikolai Bukharin's codification of his version of Leninism. While still calling for the violent overthrow of capitalism and a revolutionary dictatorship, it stresses freedom of socialist thought and political pluralism within the vanguard party itself, a pluralistic cultural sphere with minimal state interference, and an overall cautious, measured, and pedagogical attitude towards the construction of a communist society, holding that the people should learn to support socialism on their own terms and that coercive or militaristic methods to accomplish such will be both inhumane and counterproductive. In the Soviet Union itself, this led Bukharin and his faction of the Communist Party to controversially back continuation of the NEP and independent peasant agriculture, believing that forced collectivization as hardline figures advocated would be tantamount to "waging war on the population."\n\nWith the overthrow of Bukharin by Joseph Stalin in 1942, and the subsequent total disintegration of the Union over the next three years, Bolshevism stands in an unclear position. A cadre of fringe figures associated with Stalin, and the various remnant warlords claiming his legacy, blame its relative liberalism for the devastating defeat of the Union in the war and the apocalyptic consequences thereof, an argument widely rejected by historians of the subject. Most communist parties internationally still adhere to Bolshevism's principles, although with many different directions ranging from electoralist quasi-reformism to radical left-communist positions that still value pluralism."
communist_marxism_leninism_subtype_desc: "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin was one of many contenders to succeed Lenin as leader of the Soviet Union. While agreeing with Bukharin on the principle of "Socialism in One Country", he rejected the market-driven development of the New Economic Policy. Instead, he believed that the State should exercise total control over the economy to spur on rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. Private enterprise could never be trusted to develop a fully socialist state, and therefore all industry and agriculture ought to be collectivized and directed by Communist Party central planners to achieve the Union's goals. A key corollary to this policy is that, far from withering away after the revolution as the old Leninists believed, the State must indeed be strengthened a thousandfold in order to implement a full transition to a communist society. This was heresy to the likes of Bukharin, who would triumph over Stalin in the succession struggle.\n\nYet, perhaps surprisingly, Stalin gradually returned to prominence - first in the flesh, when he played a critical role in the last years of the USSR, and then with his ideas. His rump government may have proven no more successful than Bukharin's, but its state-oriented and exportable doctrines have allowed its grasp to spread around the world, even eclipsing Bukharinite Bolshevism in certain areas. Just as the Soviet Union fell to internal strife, its very ideology is now split in twain, and defined by mutual disdain."
communist_left_communist_subtype_desc: "Espousing what they claim to be the most purely Marxist doctrine, Left Communists reject nearly all major political developments that have occurred since the death of Lenin, and even some during his life. This isn't of course to say that they are entirely bound to doctrines as described in the writings of Marx and Engels, but they do seek to remain as close to its spirit as possible, even at the expense of effectiveness in the moment.\n\nA rejection of parliamentary politics entirely, a defiance of vanguard party organization and its democratic pretenses, and a firm belief in the revolution as a historical inevitability characterize the Left Communism movement. This adherence to anti-populist attitudes and a focus on theory over praxis inspires no small degree of ridicule from their fellow leftists, but given how well history has treated them so far, Left Communists rarely feel threatened by these "opportunists" as they are often called.\n\nDespite stereotypes and criticisms to that effect, Left Communists are not simply idle or lazy, awaiting for an "organic" revolution that will never come. But rather, their preparation involves planning rather than giving grand speeches, learning and studying rather than waving guns and standing on soapboxes. If knowing is half the battle, then the Left Communists have already won. It is, after all, simply a matter of time."
communist_stratocratic_communism_subtype_desc: "Stratocratic Communism arises from both circumstance and ideological drive. Despite loathing of conventional armies being common in the far-left, that sentiment typically dies out once a military apparatus is secured, and nothing has ever barred military men from adhering to that side of politics to begin with. Some men of that sort even indulge in the time-honored tradition of 'theorizing' - and where the ethos of their chosen profession meets Marxist theory, it fuses to create a new mode of thought that few other radical leftists endorse, for reasons which become quite apparent once its tenets are elaborated upon.\n\nForemost of those tenets is stated clearly in its name: the establishment of a revolutionary socialist government composed entirely of military officers and personnel. Detractors call this a cynical power-grab to hijack the revolution, little more than a revisionist junta. Those detractors (prior to their summary execution) would be met by the argument that the armed forces, being assembled from the conscripted proletariat, are the vanguard of the revolution by necessity. Moreover, the regime asserts that perpetual supremacy of the military is paramount to the ultimate triumph of socialism, for if the bourgeoisie cannot be defeated from within, it is the armed workers of the nation who must liberate their oppressed comrades by force.\n\nCries of "Revisionist!" aside, a regime of this type is still ideologically-driven and cannot simply be described as 'apolitical' or a 'junta'. It is committed to communist principles, chief among them absolute control of state, society, and economy by the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'. Still, even by the standards of a revolutionary government, Stratocratic Communism is extremely hardline, tolerating no dissent and displaying shameless aggression. Civilian leadership has no place here; only the Revolutionary Army, composed of class-conscious worker-soldiers, can ensure the propagation of the world revolution and the destruction of bourgeois imperialism."
communist_mao_zedong_thought_subtype_desc: "While the Communists may have been defeated in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ideas of one of their founders, Mao Zedong, have however not disappeared: hiding until the imperial threat falters, waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nBased on the writings Mao wrote during the Long March and his time in the Yan'an Base Area, Mao Zedong Thought borrows elements from a heavily rural-centric form of socialism, but to reduce it as a mere deviation upon it would be a mistake. Following in the footsteps of such figures as Marx, Engels, Lenin and Bukharin, Mao Zedong Thought relies on a doctrine of internationalism and anti-imperialism, but differs from traditional Bolshevism by placing an emphasis on the rural populace instead of the urban proletariat. In its fight against capitalist domination in countries where ruralism is still prevalent, it calls for revolutionary land reform and for the establishment of a system of New Democracy, adapted to conditions of the country, it also deems guerilla warfare as the best way to conduct the revolutionary struggle, under the form of a "protracted people's war".\n\nMao Zedong Thought is seen by its supporters as the natural continuation of Marxist thought, and thus as the next stage of Bolshevism: its fundamentally anti-imperialist principles have seen it adopted around the world, as oppressed peoples of all stripes begin take up arm against their oppressors. This new, revolutionary deviation of traditional Marxist thought has begun to make its mark throughout world history."
communist_amazonism_subtype_desc: "A split in the Brazilian Communist Party was all it took for a new revolutionary idea to form, and its birth led to a major shift in Latin American socialism. While many communist parties in the continent turn to electoralism, João Amazonas, the chief ideologue of the PCdoB, posits that communists must seek to violently overthrow the capitalist system in a drawn-out "people's war", involving rural guerilla warfare of the masses away from population centers.\n\nOfficially named "Marxism-Leninism-Amazonism", this movement has its roots in the ideological chaos established after the fall of the Soviet Union, being partially inspired by the failed Chinese revolutionary experience. Amazonism firmly rejects any association with capitalist powers, seeing it as a sign of betrayal of its anti-imperialist ideals, though the movements that follow this line should often collaborate with other revolutionary groups to topple the forces of imperialism. However, Amazonism is usually regarded with distrust by other factions, especially for its disposition towards economic autarky and isolationism in foreign policy.\n\nAmazonas claims that only the vanguard party can awaken the masses and raise their consciousness towards revolutionary zeal, rejecting the Guevarist line of decentralized insurgency. While Amazonist groups focus on building rural guerrillas, they do not shy away from integrating themselves into the general labor movements and union structure, sometimes being at the head of many unions' bureaucracy. This bureaucratic aspect may represent a contradiction to Amazonas' fiercest zealots, but this dualism is integral in their fight against right-wing tyranny."
communist_national_communism_subtype_desc: "When Karl Marx penned his fateful works, he imagined a global communist utopia, where workers all over the world would be free, and where the oppression of nationalism would be a distant memory, if that. This mantra was preached over and over again, organizations like the various Internationales grew and grew, and the left began to embrace the whole world in its mission. And it failed. Nikolai Bukharin championed the idea of "Socialism in One Country" when he led the Soviet Union, where a single socialist nation - the USSR - would focus on strengthening itself against reaction before liberating the world. And it failed.\n\nBut internationalism was never the sole destiny of communism. Another wing had followed it - National Communism, that had posed an answer to the national question - that communism was not the enemy of nationalism. That communism is true nationalism. It is the key to liberation from the twin devils of imperialism and capitalism, who seek to suck nations dry and leave them for dead. National Communists are as diverse as the different nations that host them, from Ukraine to Central Asia to Africa. Some support a loose union of communist states, others are more isolationist, yet they are all united by a common belief in national self-determination, communism, and anti-imperialism.\n\nFor the oppressed, for the enslaved, for all who suffer under the tyranny of imperialism and capitalism, National Communism is a beacon of hope in a dark, cruel world. And unlike other communist experiments, it may just succeed."
communist_workerism_subtype_desc: "Workerism, also known as Marxist Autonomism, is a term used to describe a network of interlinked movements and individuals emerging in the early 1960s in Italy. The original core of Workerism was a group of Marxist intellectuals who engaged in a critical revision of the interpretations of Marx's thought which had been en vogue among communists since Lenin's time. The key idea of workerism is that the traditional communist idea, preaching that the working class struggles are a reaction to capitalist development, is in fact backwards: capitalist development, according to workerists, is a reaction to the struggle of the exploited workers.\n\nThe working class is thus the "negative engine" of development, and accordingly, all revolutionary strategies must come from and be driven by the working class itself, with no interference from bourgeouis collaborationist unions and certainly not from exploitative vanguard parties. Indeed, the working class should reject any alliance with "progressive" or "empathetic" bourgeoisie. The working class must stand on its own, rely upon itself to seize power, with an emphasis on revolutionary violence and grassroots organization in order to achieve such ends. This dynamic, fresh-faced take on communist ideology has a great deal of pull among younger students and workers, for whom the fires of political and ideological enthusiasm have yet to dim."
communist_harmonism_subtype_desc: "Nikolai Bukharin was once a broken man. Having spent twenty years in the Siberian tundra, he searched for answers to questions he barely knew how to ask. One fateful evening, he came across a strange crystal that granted him a vision of a society founded on one, central principle:\n\n§CFriendship is Magic.§!\n\nHarmonic Communism is an idealistic ideology that blends elements of Bukharinism with the idea that friendship is the praxis by which a socialist society is achieved. Followers of Harmonic Communism believe in the §Cmagic of friendship§!, where every conflict in all levels of society is solved through mediation and not violence. The ideology strives to implement a society in which conflicts are a thing of the past, and in which everyone in the state lives happily with one another through the power of friendship.\n\nFollowers of Harmonic Communism do still believe in class conflict, but they believe that it can be overcome in ways other than a violent revolution. Through the power of friendship, they believe they can break down class barriers and allow for the dictatorship of the proletariat to naturally form from the peaceful mediation of the workers' struggle. While many may see this as hilariously unrealistic in its idealism, Nikolai Buckharin has proven his ideology to be both surprisingly successful and attractive to the weary citizens of Russia. Soon, harmony and socialism will be spread throughout all of Russia, and even, eventually, the world."
communist_trotskyism_subtype_desc: "With its origins as a sneer from the 1920s, the Trotskyist label was adopted by Trotsky's supporters in exile. Never abandoning the revolution, he organised an opposition within the Comintern before being hounded out by the strong hand of the Bukharin-Stalin clique. The question of the international revolution had always been of utmost importance to him, and on this basis, he would form the Fourth International. Viewing Russia as a backwards economy, only through the relief of the international revolution could it pass from pre-capitalism to socialism. Until then, the USSR was a transitional society. He termed this understanding of revolution in backwards conditions the 'Permanent Revolution', and some outside of Europe would pick up this concept as the basis for their own revolution, avoiding Bukharin's two-stages. Ultimately, he would see in Russia a degenerated revolution, a 'worker's state' corrupted by an undemocratic bureaucracy resting on the middle classes and sinking into capitalism.\n\nIn the meantime, believing the conditions were overripe for socialism and that the key element lacking was leadership, the Trotskyists attempted to take their place at the helm. They appealed to the first four congresses of the Comintern, upholding the United Front against both the 'Ultra Leftism' of the Third Period and the bourgeois Popular Front. Their strategy coalesced in 1938 in the Transitional Programme, a programme of pursuing increasingly unrealisable demands to force revolution. Trotsky himself met a fateful end in 1940 at the hands of his rivals, but the events of the 1940s suggest to some his relevance. Heeding his call, his followers have found themselves in power. Will they be able to achieve the socialist society he envisioned — democratic, staunchly internationalist, and rigorously planned — or will the bureaucracy rear its head again and begin the Thermidor anew?"
communist_guevarism_subtype_desc: "Of all the colorful personalities that took part in the Cuban Revolution, only one ever reached Fidel Castro's international fame - the Argentine Marxist known as Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. His ideas have come to be known as Guevarism.\n\nIn its current context, Guevarism is an umbrella term for a variety of leftist movements whose chief distinction is their organization around the Revolutionary Coordination Junta and Guevara as a rallying figurehead. Radically breaking from all mainstream communist thought, Guevarism outright rejects the need for any established vanguard party to organize a Marxist revolution. Instead, small fast-moving bands of insurgents act as the vanguard themselves, mimicking Che's own experiences in the Cuban Revolution. Through generating discontent among the peasant class, propagandizing, and guerrilla warfare, the insurgents will put enough pressure on any corrupt and oligarchic political system to stir the populace into armed rebellion.\n\nIts fundamentally unifying tenets are an inherent focus on the peasantry and rural areas over the traditional urban workers, armed struggle, internationalism, and a belief in revolutionary willpower - that any group of sufficiently motivated militants will find success. Guevarism has mostly found success in Latin America as the mainstream strand of leftist revolutionary thought, but it lacks a formal doctrine due to its internationalist nature, and in consequence, the many differences in thought within the organizations tied to the Junta."
communist_peoples_democracy_subtype_desc: "During the thirties, the concept of popular fronts was devised by communists growing acclimatized to parliamentary democracy as alliances with bourgeois parties against the threat of fascism. Today, fascism may have won, but the idea has not been left to the history books. It has evolved, or some might say mutated, into a new ideal for a united front, one where the proletariat dictates democracy.\n\nIn theory, while parties in a People's Democracy representing proletarian, peasant, petite bourgeois, or even national bourgeois interests can participate in the political process, the instruments of power are firmly held by a proletarian hegemony. In practice, this allows the governing communist body to exercise plenty of power over the democratic process, deciding who can and can't run. In power, each party enters into a coalition with one another, forming a front of national unity that acts as the sole legal body responsible for governance, with communists taking a leading role. Although the communists maintain their commitment to the cause of the working class and the creation of a proletarian dictatorship, compromise is often considered crucial to avoid cracks in the coalition as the country's maintenance takes priority over strict adherence to Marxist doctrine.\n\nAs a result, elections tend to be won overwhelmingly in favor of the ruling popular front, and in government, votes carried out on policy are strongly influenced by a communist line. A liberal critique of this system would argue against the fairness of such a system and question the lack of choice or freedom. The communist response to this is that it is the negation of bourgeoisie representation from power, and the elevation of the working class to governance is their critical aim. Once this has been achieved, the democratic road can be ridden to the very end until the destination of socialism has been reached."

socialist_revolutionary_gaitanismo_subtype_desc: "Less of an ideology and more of a set of beliefs held by Fidel Castro and his comrades, Revolutionary Gaitanismo has spread across Latin America following the success of the Cuban Revolution. Arguing that Marxism is fully compatible with the radical republicanism of Gaitanismo and rejecting Leninism, its adherents call upon all progressive forces —- the proletariat, students, bourgeois nationalists, and even the clergy and petit bourgeoisie — to unite under the banner of revolution, either through armed struggle led by a guerrilla vanguard, or civic struggle led by a mass populist party.\n\nTheir ultimate goal is a true proletarian republic as Gaitán would have wanted across Latin America; a multi-party direct democracy bound by revolutionary consensus, where the people participate through elected popular councils at local and provincial levels, and defended by the guerrilla army who will send caudillismo and capitalism to their graves. Fiercely anti-capitalist, its adherents promote a planned economy and economic nationalism, even maintaining the market at the local level to generate capital where the state cannot. \n\nThe young guard of Gaitanismo are united in their conviction that social revolution is the only way for any change, that revolution must always result in socialist democracy, and that all tyrants must fall for a free and socialist Latin America!"
socialist_anarcho_communist_subtype_desc: "From the streets of Barcelona to the fields of China, anarchism is as tenacious and as stubborn as a rat. It would seem, at least on the surface, that anarchism is like a hydra- for every anarchist that is killed, imprisoned, or 'disappeared', two more will pop up in their place. But why?\n\nAnarcho-Communism is a radical left-wing ideology that is contrasted to more standard socialist ideologies like Marxism and democratic socialism by its strong opposition to authority, which it claims as synonymous with the evils of capitalism. Anarcho-communists are also notable for their distaste for large-scale industrialization, preferring to rely on local communes and farms for production. Anarcho-communists have had several brief moments of relative power, most notably with Nestor Makhno's Free Territory in Ukraine in 1920. But just as anarcho-communist societies are united behind common goals, they are also divided by almost everything else. Infighting, chaos and confusion are present in all anarcho-communist societies, and this usually leads to their downfall.\n\nModern Anarcho-Communism began with the works of thinkers like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin in the mid-1800s. Seeking the total destruction of all forms of oppression, from capitalism to racism to the state itself, anarcho-communists exist in their own political bubble- scorned by the left and hated by the right. Nonetheless, Anarcho-Communism serves as a beacon of hope for any who have been cast aside by the existing system. One can be sure that no matter how dark and authoritarian the world becomes, anarchists will be hiding in the shadows, waiting for their opportunity to spring forth and realize their cries of 'no gods, no masters.'"
socialist_christian_socialism_subtype_desc: "Christian Socialism is a broad umbrella term to describe all beliefs that combine the moral teachings of Jesus Christ with the economic theory of left-wing ideologues. This mix spiritualism and materialism may seem like an oxymoron at first glance, but that has not stopped thinkers and theologians from synthesizing the two. They consider themselves to be just as devout as any other Christian, and they reject Marxist beliefs that religion is an "opiate of the masses" that is ultimately incompatible with the goal of revolution.\n\nAlthough many argue that socialism is inherently hostile to Christianity, Christian socialists argue that it is actually capitalism that is incompatible: they consider it to be akin to idolatry, a cult of the Almighty Dollar that encourages greed and condemns charity. They turn to the Bible to both support their viewpoints, pointing out that Jesus said "One cannot serve both God and wealth," as well as how the earliest Christians "held everything in common" and collectively shared their possessions. Only collectivist social policies, they say, can stay close to Christ's teachings while also helping all those in society."
socialist_revolutionary_frontism_subtype_desc: "The Revolutionary Front is, at least in theory, a unified coalition of various different sects, strains and factions of the socialist, communist and anarchist left, all with the intended purpose of gaining institutional and government power to establish socialism. In practice, this means such varying ideologies as Democratic Socialists, who believe in revolution through the ballot box, and authoritarian socialists, who are disgusted with what they describe as 'bourgeois democracy', are expected to cooperate and work together for the advancement of socialism.\n\nThis, unsurprisingly, can lead to a very incoherent bloc, with actual governing policies being based upon internal compromise or the result of certain factions winning out against others. Typically, the Revolutionary Front is most often seen in places where the political left can only hope to maintain power through a big tent and coalition building, or in places that are under threat from the right wing that seek to undermine the ability for such left parties to exist in the first place.\n\nRevolutionary Front leaders are as diverse as their base, and are often instrumental in maintaining the survival of the Front in the first place, if not its actual creator. Whether a Revolutionary Front can survive its leader, however, depends on whether it can learn sacrifice ideological purity for the sake of political (and sometimes literal) survival."

socialist_agrarian_socialism_subtype_desc: "Unlike Marxist Socialism, which theorizes the driving force of the revolution to be the urban proletariat, Agrarian Socialism places the peasantry at the forefront of the revolution.\n\nMostly popular in scarcely-industrialized, undeveloped states, its ideal society is based on an agrarian vision of society, where the land is owned by the people instead of by a landlord class. Along with a socialistic economic system, and the collective ownership of the means of production, agrarian socialism aims to realise an agrarian utopia, where the farmer toils away happily, for he knows that he truly and finally gets to reap the ripe fruits of his labor.\n\nImportant to note, however, is that Agrarian Socialism is not an inherently revolutionary ideology: indeed, it can come to power through the ballot box as well as through the barrel of a gun, which makes it a quite broad and adaptable ideology to its supporters. Of course, it is not without its detractors: claims from the left that socialism and true equality cannot be achieved without industrialisation coincide with more "traditional" critiques from the right, which argue against the merits of socialism altogether."
socialist_syndicalism_subtype_desc: "What is socialism? In short, it is the workers' ownership of the means of production, whether directly or through the state. What, then, is more purely socialistic than Syndicalism - the idea that workers wrest from the capitalist class control of society and the economy through the revolutionary action of the general strike, and build a new society on the basis of trade unions directly composed of the workers themselves, with no middleman?\n\nSyndicalism argues for direct action - strikes, sabotage of production, and demonstrations - against the capitalist system both to secure better conditions for workers while living under capitalism and to ultimately overthrow and replace it altogether. Though the successes of the October Revolution and other factors sent the syndicalist movement into decline and marginalization, it has never truly gone away; perhaps one day, a new generation of syndicalists will strike fear into the hearts of bourgeoisie and politicians alike as the militants and saboteurs of the early 1900s did."
socialist_panafricanism_subtype_desc: "First springing to life in the early 20th century, Pan-Africanism stands as the product of years of European oppression, from the British to the French to the Germans to a dozen other nations besides. Its proponents reject the idea of individual African nations, socialist or otherwise- instead preaching that, in order to truly stand against European colonizers, Africa must stand united under one banner. Falling on the far-left of the political spectrum, Pan-Africanism can be easily differed from its counterpart in African Socialism by its vanguardist attitude, its emphasis on anti-imperialism, and its staunch adherence to a pan-national identity for what Europe once called the "Dark Continent".\n\nWhile its adherents are primarily found in West Africa- specifically Cameroon- and South Africa as a major part of the ANC, ideologues can be found from Cape Town to Cairo- even gaining traction among Black communities in the United States and the Caribbean. Motivated, angry, and aggressive in spreading its influence, those with interests in the region should keep an eye on the Pan-Africanists."
socialist_baathism_subtype_desc: "$despotism_baathism_subtype_desc$"
socialist_left_wing_nationalism_subtype_desc: "From the East to the West, from the most developed nation to the least, there arises a new trend in politics of the new age: left-wing nationalism. Espousing left-wing ideals of equality, class consciousness, and the ideal of a socialist modernity, its believers aim to challenge imperialism by fashioning these ideas into a clarion call for self-determination and independence. The proponents of left-wing nationalism transform socialist agitation into a weapon with which to combat either imperialist interference and influence in society.\n\nIn the Cold War, left-wing nationalism is a wide label: it describes both revolutionary tendencies and electoralist reform; it covers a broad range of adherents, from Europe to Asia, from Africa to America. Despite this wide-ranging appellation, however, they all have something in common: nationalism is not irreconcilable with socialism or socialistic policies, and that self-determination and political independence is a necessary step in achieving equality and liberty."
socialist_african_socialism_subtype_desc: "They talk of the failure of socialism, but where is the success of capitalism in Africa? African Socialism is an ideology formed as a result of the sudden independence achieved by many former French and British colonies in the wake of the Second World War. Instead of following their former colonizers in pursuing a capitalist model, African Socialists sought out an ideology that was more afrocentric.\n\nThe main distinction between African Socialism and more classical strains of socialism is the focus on the sharing of economic resources in a traditional African way. Some African Socialists believe that Africa's background in tribal community life excludes the validity of the theory of class struggle, and makes socialism the natural way of life for African nations.\n\nWhile pan-Africanist, this form of African Socialism does not conform to the ideology adhered to by Cameroon. This form of African Socialism is much more grassroots and decentralized. Seeking a more moderate path, this strain of African Socialism seeks to respect local African traditions and structures. It is also not focused on expansionism, unlike the Cameroonian brand, although it is not necessarily opposed to violence."
socialist_islamic_socialism_subtype_desc: ""Look at all religions. Look at Moses. Did Moses not rebel before three symbols? Korah, the greatest capitalist of his time. Balaam, the greatest priest of the deviated religion of multi-theism. And the Pharaoh, the greatest symbol of political power of his time. Did he not arise against the status quo?" - Ali Shariati\n\nThe rise of Islam represented the greatest political, social and economic revolution to have ever rocked the Arabian peninsula and the world at large. The self-serving and corrupt polytheism that came before it was uprooted from every crevice of Arabian society, and a new revolutionary order that promised a more egalitarian state of affairs and served to unify the disparate tribes of Arabia into one whole would come to be. And yet to many, among them, Abu Dhur al-Ghiffari, a companion of the prophet, the accumulation of wealth that followed the death of the Islamic Prophet was nothing but a bastardisation of Islamic doctrine and ideals.\n\nDrawing upon this analysis, the enshrined principle of Zakat and the revolutionary nature of the First Islamic State, the Islamic socialists - be they Sunnis or Shiites - aim to liberate the Ummah from the chains of capitalism and the reactionary culture of self-indulgence and exploitation that it perpetuates. And from upon the ruins of the capitalist system, the old Ummah will be morphed into a revolutionary, social and anti-colonial community that redistributes its wealth equitably, ensures that no one person is left hungry, unclothed or without shelter and that no toiler is left uncompensated for their labour."
socialist_social_democracy_subtype_desc: "Social Democracy is the mainstream that developed from the world of socialist mass politics following the October Revolution. Although it generally rejects wholesale embrace of reformist politics, it also stands against the Bolshevist line of revolutionary organization, developing a line that is ultimately agnostic on the matter of reform or revolution. Tracing ideological lineage from the Orthodox Marxism of the Second International, and from the Centrist Marxism of the 2 ½ international, Social Democratic parties tend to participate within the conventions of liberal democracy upon utilitarian bases.\n\nFollowing the failures of the Second World War, modern Social Democrats often serve as the nucleus of revolutionary movements across the world, demonstrating a willingness to form a broad consensus among antifascist or anticapitalist groups as opposed to the strict revolutionary lines preferred by Communists. This approach, however, may render the movement vulnerable to opportunist subversion that could lead towards the ruin of the Social Democratic struggle itself."
socialist_buddhist_socialism_subtype_desc: "Buddhist Socialism, sometimes also called Dhammic Socialism, refers to a wide range of views within Asia which in some way combine the economic and social equity associated with socialism and the traditional beliefs, precepts, and morals of Buddhist thinking. It is a broad term, not limited to a specific sect, and individuals who identify with the label hold varying convictions on democracy, monarchy, Marxism, and a number of other key issues. Buddhist Socialism inspires in some images of Norodom Sihanouk, in others visions of Peljidiin Genden, and in others still snapshots of Buddhadāsa Bhikku.\n\nHowever, this diversity in thought does not render the term useless, as Buddhist Socialism still refers to quite a specific political phenomenon. It represents a drive among a number of leaders and communities to modernize Buddhist thought and combine it with the influences of Western philosophies, yet so too does it represent a partial rejection of Western views on government requiring separation from a singular guiding religion. To a Buddhist socialist, the world Western socialists speak of is incompatible with their secular values, for how would a world of egalitarianism without the trappings of greed be possible but through the teachings of the Buddha?"
socialist_socialist_zionism_subtype_desc: "The original objective of Zionism as formulated by Theodor Herzl has been the transformation of the Jewish people from the abnormality of diasporic life into the normality of nationhood, in their own land and with their own national economy, accepted by the community of nations. Although the liberal Herzl is remembered as the father of modern Zionism, he was not the first to express the link between the people and their homeland. Before him, and significantly to his left, came Moses Hess. Although a prominent socialist in his own right, as a Jew, he strived to solve the historical issues of the Jewish people through nationalism. Hess believed that one of the greatest problems of diaspora Jewry was its disconnect from labor, barred from natural economic development through generations of externally— and internally— enforced seclusion. He proposed the return of Jews to their ancient homeland, as a means for them to return to the land and to labor, and the subsequent establishment of an agrarian commonwealth in Palestine.\n\nIt would take four decades for Hess' Socialist proto-Zionism to finally receive capable heirs. These Jewish socialists and social democrats made up the second major wave of immigrants to Palestine, at the turn of the 20th century, pioneering agricultural communities built along strict socialist principles, known as the kibbutzim. These collective communities, where property and social lives are held in common and children are communally raised and educated, are the beating heart of the Socialist Zionist movement, and according to many Socialist Zionists, the closest humankind has come to building proper socialism. Through these collective institutions, Socialist Zionists strive to liberate the Jewish homeland and build the basis for a proper national economy, a Marxist stage of development which was denied to the Jews in the diaspora. From there, a proper Jewish proletariat can be formed, to participate in the international class struggle."

progressivism_gaitanismo_subtype_desc: "To Colombia, Gaitanismo is not an ideology but a new national ideal for Latin America itself, and an inspiration for left-wing politicians across the region.\n\nBorn with the entrance of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán into politics, Gaitanismo emerged as liberal socialism, staunchly anti-fascist populism, and a democratic alternative to Bolshevism. Eclectic in its social decisions, Gaitanismo aims to reach as broad a base as possible, to extend democracy through all levels of society.\n\nReplacing bourgeoisie and proletariat, Gaitanismo has the national country and the political country, the former the people, the latter the oligarchical elites. The national country must overthrow the political country to create a genuine liberal democracy, united as one by nationality, and a peaceful compromise between owner and worker. Socialist economic policies that welcome foreign investment and reforms that strengthen democracy are the trademarks of Gaitanismo. Geopolitically, it calls for inter-Americanism, namely close cooperation with the OFN and other liberal democracies to fund revolutionary reforms.\n\nGaitanismo brought Colombia four golden years of peace and international admiration. The murder of its founder and the chaos of La Violencia only made Gaitanismo's flame grow brighter, and its legacy of success can be reclaimed, not only in Colombia but wherever Gaitán's flaming speeches left a mark."
progressivism_reformist_socialism_subtype_desc: "Reformist Socialism is an umbrella term covering leftist movements that for various reasons still wish to operate within a fundamentally capitalist framework. Proponents of Reformist Socialism do not seek the immediate (or even forseeable) abolition of the Market as a defining factor in managing production, but instead place a high value upon democracy in both the workplace and in government, generally believing in at least a minimum input from workers in the production of goods and services. This tends to primarily manifest as a partnership between parliamentary coalitions and organized labor.\n\nTypically, Reformist Socialists can trace a vague lineage from the theories of Edouard Bernstein of the SPD, although Marxist roots are not a requirement, and in fact actively spurned by many modern Reformist Socialist parties."
progressivism_left_wing_populism_subtype_desc: "As the popular masses work all over the world in search of riches, hoping that they someday will attain the level of their masters; as inequality and hunger ravages even in developed countries; as the elites enrich themselves off the backs of the people, some people stand up and say "No". No to poverty, no to hunger, and most of all no to wealth disparity, for injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\nLeft-Wing Populism is the umbrella under which these people fall, although it is not a coherent ideology as much as it is a broad movement: combining anti-elites and left-wing rhetoric with populistic economic measures, those who claim an affiliation to it style themselves as the defenders of the "common people", opposing the economic elites and the establishment who oppress the poor and the little man. However, it is not too rooted in socialist theory, generally eschewing Marx or Lenin in favor of James Connolly or Léon Blum, and its most radical part is quite often its rhetoric, calling for the uprooting of the political and economic elites and for a fairer and juster society made by and for the people. And with a lot of effort and a tad of luck, such a society might even come true."
progressivism_left_kemalism_subtype_desc: "In prior decades, Kemalism held an almost monolithic presence within Turkish politics, encompassing left, right and centre. However, in recent years, Turkey's right flank has steadily drifted away from Kemalism's desire to emulate Western notions of progress, largely due to Kemalist prohibitions on religious expression and growing support for a model inspired by the fascist powers. As a response, many Kemalists have decided to emphasise the progressive aspects of their ideology and Atatürk's legacy, seeking to realign Kemalism to the left of centre, with a much greater commitment to social welfare. Emphasising populism and reformism, as opposed to their more nationalism-oriented orthodox cousins, Left Kemalists continue to espouse a Turkish national identity which may remain alienating towards certain minority groups."
progressivism_popular_front_subtype_desc: "United we stand, divided we fall.\n\nNo ideology exemplifies this so clearly as the Popular Front. Most typically drawn from a very, very broadly leftist set of ideologies, the Popular Front can include support from hardcore, insurrectionist communists all the way to democratic liberals and everything in between. Sometimes, in extreme cases, it can even include conservatives in the mix, though that is certainly a rarity. Often, these temporary arrangements are made when there is a significant shift in the status quo, or the threat of such a shift in some cases, and those opposed put aside their differences to fight against it, whether that be electorally, with armed conflict, or by other means.\n\nThe concept of the Popular Front is as broad in its application as it is in its composition. The Front is usually forged first by finding some bare minimum ground, often of the moral variety, upon which to oppose the nascent threat. In other instances, a common matter of policy or ideology provides the adhesive element that keeps the Popular Front united, if the Front itself might lean more socialist or more liberal in its composition. And then its strategy is solidified, whether it is an agreement to vote in accordance with one another, or to support one another in terms of direct action and conflicts in the streets.\n\nThe sheer variety of applications of the Popular Front, as it should be clear, makes it hard to define precisely. As such, it may not be considered much of an ideology at all, so much as a strategy that parties and groups of parties pursue to advance their ideologies."
progressivism_social_radicalism_subtype_desc: "While many in the liberal sphere have utterly rejected Marxist principles and the ideologies that it spawned, others have found common ground on many of its more reasonable points. Equality is a common value between both the radicals and the socialists, after all, and much ground has yet to be gained until true equality is reached. While mainstream Radicalism will reject all socialists and socialist philosophy wholesale as a matter of principle, it is the Social Radical who finds common ground with them, reaching for their mutual goals and putting aside historical rivalries to do so.\n\nAbove all else, the Social Radical aims for the establishment of equality, an end to want, and the elevation of social programs to aid in the former two ambitions. They are willing to make whatever compromises are necessary to end inequality in whatever forms it takes. Many further to their right call them idealistic, naive even, and those further to their left call them unimaginative, lacking in ambition or true dedication to the cause they profess.\n\nDespite this disdain they receive from both ends of the political spectrum, Social Radicalism continues to plow its own road ahead, to finish the work that the Enlightenment had started."
progressivism_christian_progressivism_subtype_desc: "Christian Progressivism is a form of Christian Democracy in which a heavy amount of emphasis is put upon the ideals of justice, tolerance and the need to care for the poor and oppressed as preached by Jesus Christ. It differs from most other forms of Christian Democracy by virtue of a greater impetus for social change, as opposed to a call for conservatism, though it still maintains the belief that Democracy is the best means of achieving Christian values. Oftentimes, it seeks to interpret Christianity through the lens of modern knowledge, science and ethics, as opposed to those held at the time of the writing of the scriptures. In terms of economic policy, Christian Progressivism is usually in the center, though it can lean further to the left or to the right depending on the specific application. Socially, Christian Progressivism is usually center-left, being especially likely to be so on issues such as Civil Rights. However, Christian Progressives can often lean conservative on certain issues due to the fact that the ideology is still heavily based on Christian thought. Christian Progressivism also tends to place more weight on Christian values and morality, as opposed to adherence to specific Christian doctrine."
progressivism_left_wing_agrarianism_subtype_desc: "Since before the Russian Revolution of 1917, the world has known a uniquely Socialist blend of rural-oriented politics; Left-Wing Agrarianism. Born from the minds of men like Alexander Herzen and Pyotr Lavrov, this new strain of Agrarianist thought is primarily oriented around typical agrarian goals: prioritization of farming in the national framework, the promotion of the farmer in the ideals of the state, and an attempt at egalitarianism; though Left-Wing Agrarianism comes with its own set of rules.\n\nConflicting with the typical Bukharinist-Marxist divide, Left-Wing Agrarianism heavily prioritizes the rural farmer in the everyday life and function of the state, and sees them as a class in of themselves, no matter how many times the unique strain of Socialism finds itself being called ideological heathens in doing so."
progressivism_liberal_socialism_subtype_desc: "A propagandist or an illiterate might well look at Liberal Socialism and say something along the lines of "there is no difference between a liberal socialist and a progressive democrat". This is wrong—a liberal socialist, unlike a progressive, will self-identify as a socialist, and has at least a theoretical aim the construction of a socialist system.\n\nPrimary doctrines of liberal socialism include leveraging the market to further socialist goals, emphasizing welfare systems built via the construction of quality public services, and the expansion of public-private partnerships as an alternative to nationalizations. The liberal socialist ideology developed as the middle class grew in many nations through the 60s and 70s, and lost interest in outright socialism without becoming opposed to left-wing governance.\n\nThough liberal socialism insists that it remains socialist, this can be brought into question at times, especially when the policies of a nominally liberal socialist party seem similar to those of a liberal party. If this is the case, it is entirely possible that more orthodox socialist factions may reduce support or outright oppose a governing liberal socialist party, which in turn can cause massive rifts within the left wing of a multiparty democracy."
progressivism_utopian_socialism_subtype_desc: "The earliest strand of its kind, Utopian Socialism has been used as both a label of endearment and insult by leftists through the years. Originally pioneered in the early 18th and 19th century, Utopian socialism is primarily based upon both a distinct dislike of class conflict and a belief in the perfectibility of mankind and of society in general. Whether it be through the creation of local communes, making industry more efficient through nationalization of certain goods and services, or just simply a moral belief in raising the entire society as a whole through government and local intervention, utopian socialists believe that mankind as a whole can be brought up to a higher standard of living than what capitalism can currently deliver to us.\n\nThe biggest distinction between utopian socialists and their Marxist cousins is a distinct dislike of class conflict or revolution, believing instead that all classes would be willing to adhere to such a system through convincing. This places it in opposition to the materialistic worldview that Marxism and more pragmatic socialists who intend on creating working class coalitions to win power. While most utopian experiments have failed, many persist in their experiments, believing that, one day, a perfect system of humanity can be created, and that all of mankind can bask in its glory of a newer, better world."
progressivism_eastern_progressivism_subtype_desc: "For most people on the left side of the American political spectrum, Franklin Delano Roosevelt is the defining leader. With his deep roots in the Democratic Party and brain trust of established experts, he built an array of programs that formed the foundation of the modern welfare state. But Franklin is not the only figure of inspiration. For some, the Roosevelt of Hyde Park was too establishment, too traditional. Some find their inspiration elsewhere—in the rolicking and unpredictable example of his distant relative Teddy who worked his way up through the corrupt New York system determined to change it.\n\nEastern Progressives are inspired by this example. Familiar with established systems and convinced of the need for radical change, Eastern Progressivism is the ideology of reformers and public advocates. It is a movement dominated by large, old-money figures who—out of a sense of duty or for their political survival—have arrayed themselves against the institutions built by their ancestors long ago. They see an urgent need to advance science, economic development, and liberal political thought for the betterment of all people across society.\n\nWhile Eastern Progressives have much in common with their Western counterparts, there are several notable differences. First, Eastern Progressives are inspired more by large, established, and orderly cities like New York and Boston than by the openness of the American frontier. They are less gun-toting than their Western counterparts and built around established power centers. Second, this very familiarity with established power centers often makes them less willing to destroy them outright. Rather than burn the system down, Eastern Progressives are often more focused on renovating those systems and expanding them to include new groups and peoples."
progressivism_western_progressivism_subtype_desc: "For good and ill, America's sense of nationhood is inextricably tied to the frontier. The great rivers and prairies of the west were a land of opportunity where any man, regardless of birth, could make his way forwards with nothing but grit and determination. And now, the American West is the epicenter of the latest attempt to make the United States truly live up to its creed of liberty and justice for all: Western Progressivism.\n\nWhile the Progressivism of the East Coast has long since turned to compromising with the traditional institutions and power brokers of the United States in the name of change, Western Progressives turn up their noses at this pragmatism. They see all the traditional institutions of political power, from corporations to machine politics to career politicians themselves, as nothing more than tools for the powerful to keep the common man down. Western Progressives have a reputation as being a more authentic representation of the will of those they represent than the politicians of DC, immersed as they are in backroom politics. But with this authenticity can come a lack of unity and purpose, and a refusal to compromise even when doing so is necessary to political success.\n\nNow, Western Progressivism has found its home with the Progressive caucus of the NPP, seeking to lead a new American Revolution to sweep aside the legacy of racial and class inequalities forever. They have risen a wave of popular disenchantment both with the inequality of American society and the corruption of Washington to the White House. But now, they must not simply agitate, but govern. Will this new generation of American dreamers finally change the country for good, or will they become that which they swore to destroy?"
progressivism_neocorporatism_subtype_desc: "Corporatism, once a fringe belief, has become one of the twentieth century's guiding philosophies. It is the stamp of the new order, but even in the old order's democracies, its influence can be felt. The product of this mix is a new corporatism, like and yet unlike its fascist predecessor.\n\nNeocorporatism advocates against the traditional class interests, responsible in their minds for so much of the conflict and wars of the past decades. In its place, they advocate for pillarization, whereby society is organized based on specific interest groups centered around religion, nationality, political background, or another factor, each with their own institutions and social organizations, each orientated to be as inclusive as possible to avoid possible sources of tension and unrest. Ties are created between these groups, reducing conflict between interest groups that would typically oppose each other, like labor unions and corporations, allowing for better coordination and cohesion regarding economic challenges. The end result is turning otherwise economically disastrous labor disputes into structured negotiations between a few committed actors.\n\nOverall, neocorporatism abandons the rampant nationalism and totalitarian structures of its ideological predecessors, but some of its ideological adherents hold grander plans regarding it. They believe that the tripartite institutions created to deal with simple economic matters are capable of far more, capable of running the government more efficiently than the traditional liberal democratic model of majoritarian decision-making. Whether or not this belief holds true outside of the textbooks remains yet to be seen."

liberalism_national_liberal_subtype_desc: "Originating in the continental European democratic movements of the 19th century, National Liberalism is a synthesis of liberal political theory with nationalist philosophy on the integrity of the nation-state. It retains liberalism's emphasis on individual and economic freedom, but stresses that the continued health of the two is predicated on continued, unthreatened national sovereignty. National Liberal theory can manifest in anti-immigration and economically protectionist policy, but also in support for limited industrial planning and state subsidies for critical economic sectors.\n\nNational Liberal praxis, however, is not tightly bound by strict ideological tenets. Because National Liberal theory orbits the salient concerns of sovereignty and liberty, subservient policy areas can be reoriented in their defense. Protectionist economic policy can sometimes give way to free trade agreements, and industrial planning to free enterprise, if doing so is considered conducive to the maintenance of state sovereignty and individual liberty."
liberalism_liberal_radicalism_subtype_desc: "Something of a relic of the past, the concept of Radicalism holds its roots in the days of the French Revolution in specific and the Enlightenment in general, and has kept itself close to those roots moreso than the adherents of other liberal ideologies. To the Radical, the ideals of democracy, secularism, and the development and advancement of human rights come before all other priorities.\n\nAs the world continued on into the 20th century, things began to change as more and more radical ideologies took center stage. As first Marxist, and then later Fascist, ideologies began to overwhelm the continents of Europe and Asia, many strains of liberalism began to shift and evolve as reactions to the changing tides. In the 40's, Italy's and Germany's utter and complete victories over the democracies of Western Europe looked to be the deathknell of their ideology, but twenty years later, one can see that has not been the case.\n\nAfter the stagnations and failures of Italy and Germany in the 1950's, people began to look for answers once more, and a renewed faith in Enlightenment ideals has taken root in many parts of the world, especially in the West. A torch once thought snuffed out has been lit once more, and has been raised to the heavens as many call for a return to the virtues liberty, equality, and brotherhood."
liberalism_christian_liberalism_subtype_desc: "In the gospel of the Bible, it is written: "Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself". Such words have come to dominate a spectrum of political thought within various cultures adherent to the teachings of the Bible and the philosophy of Jesus Christ known to contemporary politics as Christian Liberalism; contrary to the predominantly conservative leanings of most politics where it relates to the Church, Christian Liberals are firmly in the belief, in a general sense, that all men should be treated equally and with respect, and that any overtures towards economic or societal separatism is not only a violation of the rights of man and individual liberty, but a bluntly immoral attitude that goes against the Christian principle of equality, and believe staunchly in the ideals of charity, compassion and to provide shelter and aid to the destitute and infirm.\n\nChristian Liberals will often be contrary to stiff opposition to societal reforms, or may even support said reforms themselves, believing in the words of Christ to "Render unto Caesar" and that government has no place interfering in the lives of its citizens on the basis of religion, even their own, and while they tend be averse to more radically progressive or socialist movements, with none more feared than the prospect of communism, Christian Liberals, by and large, are avowed allies to the idealism of liberal democracy, and will champion the cause of the underclass, righteously defend the cause of democracy under the providence of the Lord."
liberalism_liberal_agrarianism_subtype_desc: "Out of the many strains of Agrarian politics extant since the rise of Agrarianism as a system of thought, Liberal Agrarianism has pride of place right in the middle of politics. Liberal agrarians fervently advocate personal and economic freedom, particularly that of the farmer, the peasant, and the average rural citizen. They adhere to a proud tradition begun by the various liberal farmer's parties throughout Europe and especially.\n\nLiberal agrarianism is very distinct from its counterparts in other political-economic clades. They eschew the traditionalism and social conservatism of right-wing agrarians, instead preferring a socially moderate or even liberal stance. The socialist definition of economic justice promoted by left-wing agrarians is also dismissed by Liberal Agrarianism; to a liberal agrarian, "economic justice" is met by a capitalistic system with all appropriate changes made so that the common people of the ruralities can live prosperously."
liberalism_social_liberalism_subtype_desc: "If an individual were to enter society without a notion about their class or social status, logic and self-interest would dictate that they would fashion this society to allow its least well-off members the maximum opportunities. This is the goal of the social liberal.\n\nTraditionally, liberalism focused on the values of civic and economic freedom above all else. However, with the ruin and poverty of the twentieth century being pervasive and ubiquitous across the globe, many liberal theorists were forced to rethink their positions. The outcome of this reflection led to the birth of social liberalism, an ideology that gives the common good the same level of importance as individual freedom. To achieve this goal, state support is used to address the economic ills of its citizens in matters including, but not limited to, education, employment, health, and housing, alongside the provision of social welfare for those in need. Government intervention is also used to tackle cultural issues such as expanding civil rights and suffrage.\n\nFor its critics, the state's influence in these matters chokes out the freedom of the market in favor of government excess. But to its adherents, any imagined loss of individual freedom is more than made up for by the opportunities now afforded to the nation's most vulnerable — seeing the curtailment of the wealthy's infinite luxury as a small price to pay in the pursuit of a just society and the eradication of poverty."
liberalism_classical_liberalism_subtype_desc: "Framing itself as the ideological descendants of the Greek and Roman Republics, Classical Liberalism is a contemporary branch of liberal democratic philosophy which found a surge in popularity in the reemergence of democratic institutions in the 18th Century, the most formative of which being the American Revolution, which prided itself as the vanguard for the reintroduction of liberal thinking in global politics.\n\nCommonly considered orthodoxy by liberal thinkers, Classical Liberalism promulgates a belief in individual egalitarianism, free market economics, and a drive towards societal cohesion through promotion of moderation and reform; it tends to put more of an emphasis on preserving the rights of personal freedom first and foremost, putting it in conflict with the more staunchly economy-centric Market Liberals, combatively traditionalist Status-Quo Conservatives, as well as contemporary Progressivism for promoting expansion of the civil government to combat social inequality at the expense of the free market."

The modern American liberal is the culmination of all these figures—a stalwart defender of civil rights, equality, social justice, and a regulated market economy. They look toward the future while firmly rooted in the traditions of the past.\n\nThe liberalism of John F. Kennedy is no different. With his soaring rhetoric and unabashed optimism, John Kennedy urges Americans to look forward to new frontiers and new opportunities. Guided by "the best and the brightest" of the era and a distrust of bureaucratic procedures, Kennedy has urged all Americans to come together to eradicate poverty, eliminate bigotry, and extend their country's reach toward the stars. On the domestic front, liberalism under Kennedy has become defined by policies seeking to end American stagnation—policies that include tax cuts, minimum wage hikes, and aggressive attacks against segregation. Internationally, liberalism has become defined by a robust foreign policy—combining both an aggressive military posture toward Japan and Germany with a renewed focus on development in other states across Africa, Asia, and Europe.\n\nYet, it remains unclear whether this latest manifestation of liberalism will withstand the struggles America faces abroad and at home. Despite all the glittering images and inspiring speeches, America still faces enormous social and political challenges. There is the constant danger that the shining ideal that Kennedy puts forth will fall into the morass and be overwhelmed by extremists on the left and right."

Herein lies the continuation of the Democratic Party's generational revolution, to build a government strong enough to care for the people yet so free and accessible to ensure domestic tranquility. With the power of this almighty government, poverty, hunger, illness, and perhaps even prejudice itself can be eliminated, sweeping actions limited only by the President's ability to pass legislation and the bureaucracy's capacity to enforce such policies. Lyndon Johnson's liberalism is a relentless pursuit of righting wrongs, fighting at home to expand medical and retirement benefits, codify transformative civil rights laws, and eliminate poverty once and for all.\n\nYet, it remains unclear whether this latest manifestation of liberalism will withstand the struggles America faces abroad and at home. Despite continued efforts toward national perfection, America still faces enormous social and political challenges.

This suite of policy programs aims to revitalize cities, build infrastructure, attack crime, and create unprecedented opportunities for consumers in both the market and their workplace. Abroad, Hart's liberalism assumes a pragmatic face by softening attitudes towards Japan, seeking to de-escalate the Cold War in the Pacific in favor of further isolating the German Reich.\n\nYet, it remains unclear whether this latest manifestation of liberalism will withstand the struggles America faces abroad and at home.

It is also about reinforcing America's institutions by marginalizing those cynical, unpatriotic, and "able-bodied but lazy" persons who make up America's extremes. In foreign affairs, liberalism is about aggressively expanding democracy through the assertion of American military power.

America will assert its interests all across the globe—without apology.\n\nYet, it remains unclear whether this latest manifestation of liberalism will withstand the struggles America faces abroad and at home. There is a sense among the mainstream that this liberalism has replaced the welfare-oriented policies of previous administrations with policies of radical self-interest.

Recruiting on merit to the best of their ability, their aim is to take away as much power as possible from the hands of elected officials and party cadres. This may seem undemocratic; many have raised this objection. Liberal technocrats' response to that charge is generally to point at the sclerotic, byzantine nature of the state bureaucracies they have often emerged to respond to.\n\nSo taking away power from incompetent, illiterate elected officials is undemocratic. But how democratic is permitting bureaucrats to form political mafias that bloat the State and destroy its ability to get things done? How democratic is it to permit government officials, whose job is allegedly to serve the people, to instead engage in eye-watering degrees of internal corruption and nepotism that eat away at the state's institutions and government?\n\nIf that is one's idea of liberty, so be it—but the liberal technocrat will never accept that answer.

liberal_conservatism_market_liberalism_subtype_desc: "Market Liberalism was, at one point and time, the largest strain of political thought in the West. Whether it was the Liberals of Great Britain, the Republicans in America, or the Radical Liberals of France, it dominated the West under its most three most famous policies: free speech, free election, and free trade.\n\nNow, though, Market Liberalism has to contend with alternate ideas from both the right and the left, believing that it has been unwilling to deal with the human cost of its ideas. But its adherents are still many, especially in the Americas. Believing in a government that does not intervene in the economy or in the private space of its citizens, Market Liberalism seeks to create a society that ensures that every man can become successful, with a little hard work and ingenuity.\n\nPractically, this means lowering taxes, eliminating trade barriers, and ensuring an 'equal playing field' for everyone.

Believing in the sanctity of the free market, Market Liberals believe that a 'rising tide can raise all ships', regardless of whether those ships are poor or rich."
liberal_conservatism_christian_democracy_subtype_desc: "Christian Democracy is founded on two pillars of thought: that it's the duty of those that believe in God to help the people, and that democracy is the best form of government there is. Beyond this foundation, there is next to no set standard of what is Christian Democracy, and there are many beliefs and ideas on how to go about it.\n\nSome parties are opposed to both of the "materialist" ideologies of Capitalism and Socialism, while others support a social market economy that supports free market economics with a strong government supported safety net and regulations. Other parties claiming to be Christain Democratic can be seen as either conservative or liberal depending on the country and history. Or they can straddle the line: maybe they are center-left on economic issues and civil rights, while center-right on cultural, social and moral issues.\n\nChristian Democracy can be almost any denomination, though most are Catholic or some variation of Protestantism. While the European home of the original Christian Democratic movements such as Germany, Austria and Belgium are now held in the tight grasp of anti-religious Nazism, there is a flourishing Christian Democratic movement in Latin America, and hope that someday a democracy that is humble, moral and blessed will return to Europe."

A state where power belongs to the people through the form of an electoral mandate granted by them to their representatives. This may seem incompatible with the concept of oligarchic rule at first, yet should one look beyond the horizons of strict ideological confines one will arrive at the point where contradictions melt away and unity is crafted. Oligarchs with their wealth and affluence may be out of touch with the ferocious masses, yet by positioning themselves as the vanguard of the popular interests, these same oligarchs are able to place themselves at the head of the democratic process.\n\nPower belongs to the people and power originates from the people, however, the people cannot truly rule for themselves.

This is a calculated move: the Centrist Progressive's ideal support base is the sum of moderates who identify with limited portions of leftist policy and leftists who decide to satisfy themselves with center-leftist policy for the time being. Naturally. this leads to accusations that centrist progressives are nothing but sellouts trying to trick the left into voting for them.\n\nThis can be true in some cases. But what is also true is that reactionaries tend to oppose centrist progressives with the same zeal as they do the left. They're right to be afraid—those opposed to progress know that a centrist progressive can form a large coalition capable of threatening their interests. Worse yet for the oligarchic classes, red-baiting tactics will not work on centrist progressives—especially when so many of them are bona-fide anti-communists."

Paternalistic conservatism represents the latter of these types.\n\nPreoccupied with concepts such as duty and honor, paternalistic conservatism argues that the privileged members of a society are the most capable of caring for the poor and destitute around them. They encourage humanitarianism and private charity, viewing elites as benevolent actors able to ensure that those below them have access to economic opportunity. Although they support social safety nets and other forms of government intervention to guarantee good working conditions for the poor, they strongly oppose anything resembling a command economy. Instead, they aspire to use elites to balance the interests of the individual and the state, hoping that it promotes stability for all."
conservatism_islamic_conservatism_subtype_desc: ""The Muslim does not consider his religion in full being unless there exists a strong, independent Islamic state capable of enforcing the sharia without opposition or foreign control."\n\nAllah chose Muhammed, Peace Be Upon Him, to be his prophet and so through him, Allah blessed the people of Earth with the Quran, an utterly perfect scripture of immutable divinity, and within it was a treasure-trove of knowledge and virtue. In the Quran and with the aid of the Prophet's Hadith, a noble system of law was outlined that would replace all earthly laws: the Sharia.\n\nTo reject Sharia is to reject the words of Allah, however, the Sharia was always a system of laws and not a form of government. Due to this, many have instead rejected the outdated, autocratic forms of Government that the nobles and the clerics often uphold, preferring a purely Islamic form of democracy that rejects both Western encroachment and traditional autocracies.\n\nChampioning the people's right to govern themselves, while maintaining a strong allegiance to the principles of Islamic Sharia and its code of Jurisprudence, the "Islamic Conservatives" desire to defend long-held Islamic traditions from the rotten Kufr that they see Liberals, Modernists, Westerners and Socialists as propagating.\n\nFor the Islamic Conservatives, only when united as one, stable, democratic and prosperous society under the rule of Allah's Laws, can the Islamic Ummah crush the hand of imperialism and return to the forefront of the World."
conservatism_populist_conservatism_subtype_desc: "There is a stereotype about conservatives. The stodgy, stubborn, unwavering moralist is an everpresent figure in the minds of all sorts of people- both on the far left and the far right. But there is another prominent type of conservative, and in many ways they are the exact opposite of the common sentiment. Rowdy, tenacious, and fiercely pragmatic in their crusade to maintain the spirit of their nation and people, the Conservative Populist is a fiery figure on par with any socialist rabblerouser or fascist provocateur.\n\nOften, these brands of conservatives are not only not averse to passing reform, but they're even fully on board with passing certain reforms that help the common man in direct ways. These reforms, however, are always geared towards curtailing radical sentiment and ensuring the survival of the status quo in whatever form they can manage.\n\nAs such, Conservative Populists tend to do the best among rural populations, where both a respect for tradition but also understanding and reacting to the day-to-day struggles of the everyman in a timely and competent fashion is respected equally. When properly mobilized, this bloc of support can be one of the strongest in most nations, and Populists of this bent are often derided as demagogues and hellraisers for exactly this reason."
conservatism_christian_conservatism_subtype_desc: "Today is bleak. The present is filled with horrors incomprehensible to mankind mere generations ago as fascists control the fate of continents, enslaving entire peoples. It is little wonder why so many have chosen to say: "To hell with the future, long live the past," a decidedly more holy past...\n\nWhile the separation of church and state may be a relatively new concept in the grand span of history, most, if not all Christian Conservatives hold it as a ruin brought to power by today's faithless demagogues, for it is just one of the many sins running rife in the world, a symptom of people who have abandoned their traditions and traded love for wrath. These traditions provide the commandants for modern life; if the great people of yesterday lived according to these decent Christian values, who are we to say we know better than them?\n\nTheir social attitudes may be set in a conservative concrete, but their positions on the economy vary. Many believe that overt state influence is a socialist excess best avoided, meaning that functions such as the provision of social welfare are matters that the state should leave to the Church and its generous charity. Others take a more pragmatic view against overt laissez-faire economics, believing in the nurturing hand the state can provide to encourage and instill Christian morals into its populace alongside dampening the fires of class conflict. Regardless of these minor quibbles, they remain united by a common God and a common fight against the totalitarianism of today, even if it remains to be seen whether or not religion can return as a leading light of the world when the new order has already prevailed."
conservatism_progressive_conservatism_subtype_desc: "Conservatism isn't a unified banner. It is the bedrock to which sprout multiple beliefs only loosely united as opposition or adversaries to the hundred other political ideologies all over the world; Thus, it shouldn't come as a surprise that an ideology can evolve to embrace some values that other conservatives would think as "too much".\n\nProgressive Conservatism is the brainchild of those seeking a compromise, or perhaps a means to ease their mind and that of their voters: Welfare, Equal Rights, measured Economic Interventionism, all measures that alleviate societal woes without risking the bedrock that unites the country and its traditions, and hopefully guide their society, and voters, towards a healthier ecosystem without the drastic changes that they still so abhor."
conservatism_silent_conservatism_subtype_desc: "In a world of unchecked radicalism and tyranny, America requires a steady, conservative hand to steer the nation from destruction. To this end, Richard Milhous Nixon has developed a unique strand of American conservatism in order to ensure the prosperity and stability of the United States in the face of constant internal and external threats. Taking its name from Nixon's appeal to the so-called "Silent Majority" in American politics, Silent Conservatism combines the interests of pro-Republican Party business groups and culturally conservative voters in the Democratic Party to create a cautious, pragmatic approach to solving the economic and social issues within the country.\n\nWhile primarily conservative in nature, Silent Conservatism seeks to create a moderate alternative to what it sees as naïve liberals and heartless reactionaries who threaten domestic politics. Rejecting radicalism from both sides of the political spectrum, its proponents instead attempt to appeal to the vast sea of voting blocs in America through broadly populist rhetoric, flexible reforms, and a paternalistic attitude towards the nation's citizens.\n\nOwing in large part to Nixon's own pragmatism, Silent Conservatism often hesitates in taking any strong positions on political issues, instead preferring to stick to a middle-ground that largely follows the majority opinion on any particular subject. While mostly successful so far in ensuring the stability of the deeply divided Republican-Democratic Coalition, time will tell whether or not Nixon's approach to politics can continue to walk the tightrope between the increasingly divisive issues that plague the nation."
conservatism_natural_conservatism_subtype_desc: "America has always been defined by its suspicion toward large, centralized power. Thomas Jefferson was concerned that a strong government would undermine the rights of the individual. In the Federalist Papers, James Madison wrote extensively on the need for a federal system that could limit and control the abuses of government. Even John Adams believed that "Whoever would found a state and make proper laws for the government of it must presume that all men are bad by nature."\n\nNatural Conservatism is just the latest manifestation of this current. With a political center in the Sunbelt, Natural Conservatives are a group of conservatives deeply concerned by the excesses of the modern welfare state and the ability of it to intrude upon their communities. Its adherents believe that the "natural" organization of humanity is one where every town, county, and state should be free to determine what works best for them with minimal outside interference. They believe that the role of the federal government should not be to enforce standards or manipulate the fabric of society but to be as unobtrusive as possible, visible only insofar as is necessary to guarantee individual rights and allow business to thrive.\n\nOf course, the kinds of societies that Natural Conservatives hope for vary wildly. While some individuals in the Chamber of Commerce see it as essential for free speech and enterprise, others in the Deep South would use it to promote concepts that might be seen as unfair or biased against minorities. Only time can tell how these various groups will co-exist and whether their opposition to outside influence might have ramifications yet to be understood."
conservatism_urban_populism_subtype_desc: "The modern world is rife with problems. For many across the United States, they can seem entrenched, unresolvable. Millions find themselves discouraged about the injustices around them and the apparent inability of the liberal democratic order to solve them. In response, some have turned toward new, modern methods promoted by the nation's experts. They have turned toward Modern Conservatism.\n\nChampioned by moderate Republican figures such as George Romney, Modern Conservatism holds that the expertise of "leading citizens" is what is necessary to solve the political crises of today. In this way, modern conservatives believe strongly in both the virtue of volunteerism and frequently engage with allies at think tanks, nonprofits, and corporations across the country. Adherents are more likely to talk about "evidence-based policymaking" than principles or tests for ideological purity. They preference scientifically derived, consensus-oriented solutions over gut partisanship—embracing common-sense policies like flat-rate income taxes and fair and desegregated housing.\n\nWhile popular among the managerial class, it is not an ideology that inspires passionate rhetoric or thundering defenses. Rather, Modern Conservatism is often seen as corporate, technocratic, and paternalistic in a way that can be off-putting to liberals and rural conservatives alike. Only time can tell whether this new movement can win over its skeptics or whether it will deepen the public's alienation."
conservatism_prairie_populism_subtype_desc: "Born out of the traditions and physical realities of the frontier, Prairie Populism is a political creed that holds to the wisdom and honesty of the common man in his struggle against the immoral corruption of the elites. Prairie Populists laud the virtuosity of everyday men and stand alongside them to decry the supposed wickedness and dishonour of the powerful, laying the blame for the ills of society and the failures of government on those who have more money and connections than they do sense and decency. For Prairie Populists, it is the mistakes of a self-interested elite—disconnected and isolated from the struggles of the everyday, ordinary men and women of the country—that caused the problems that befall society; therefore, it is only by the removal of that elite from power that those problems can be solved.\n\nTending towards a practical, 'common sense' approach to governance, political leaders of this stripe exercise flexibility in their policy-making, adhering first and foremost to what the people themselves seem to want. Prairie Populists can advocate moderate or even progressive solutions to economic and social problems, but always with an underlying moralism and esteem for tradition that is hostile to radical or revolutionary changes in the structure of society. Steadfastly supportive of democracy and of the conceptual idea of state institutions, it is only the kleptocrats and the ne'er-do-wells defiling the halls of power, and not those halls themselves, that the Prairie Populist seeks to tear down. Theirs is the farmer's and the worker's cries of "throw the bums out!", and for those alienated from their government and feeling cheated and debased by their politicians, it can be a powerful cry indeed."
conservatism_goken_conservatism_subtype_desc: "Japan's unique political environment is characterized by many unspoken norms, and Goken Conservatism, or Constitution Protection Conservatism, was born during the Goken Undo in the 1910s. In short, it is an ideology that attempts to build representative democracy while abiding by all the norms. For example, the term "democracy," which loosely translates into "Popular Sovereignty" in Japanese, is a taboo since it challenges the Imperial Sovereign. "Constitution protection" is however a perfectly acceptable alternative as it avoids the issue of sovereignty altogether and instead focuses on protecting people's rights, sanctioned by the Emperor and outlined in the Imperial Constitution, from malignant actors like Meiji oligarchs or the Toseiha officers in the past.\n\nNeedless to say, as a form of conservatism, Goken Conservatism embraces many traditional values such as patriotism, traditional gender roles, and disdain for Western Democracy. At the same time, the adherents of Goken Conservatism also seek to ensure national policies reflect the popular will via electoral politics while attempting to interpret the popular will in accordance with Imperial Sovereignty. Although the narrative of Goken Conservatism makes the system particularly vulnerable to Meiji Era constitutional loopholes designed to empower the Emperor, it is nevertheless a genuine attempt to return to Japan's interrupted democratic experiments in the Taisho Era after thirty years of totalitarianism."
conservatism_liberal_corporatism_subtype_desc: "Amidst what can only be described as a terminal decline of classical liberalism, which emanated from the likes of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and David Ricardo less than a century before, lies fundamental questions concerning the future of european capitalism. As Nazi banners - carrying before them the unfeeling, Bismarckian tentacles of collectivism - paraded through the streets of Paris, Moscow and London, along with them came the permanent fragmentation of a unified liberal philosophy. What tools are left to those few who still believe in the capitalist system is now naught but the rigid authoritarian institutions that merely further reinforce the dominant Prussian family state".\n\nFinding roots amongst some of the early compromises between governments and the trade unions of early 20th-century Scandinavia, Liberal Corporatism represents a uniquely continental model of capitalist development. In many ways, the development of a Liberal Corporatist order has emerged spontaneously, and only in cases where the power of governments to resolve the co-determination issue can overcome vested labor and capital interests. At the centre of the Liberal Corporatist model is a perfectly organised method of enterprise bargaining. Democracy becomes a question of efficiency. Social politics mean organization and increased productivity. Labor disputes become "non-political." The more the strength of labor unions to act as industrial cartels become apparent, the more attractive the idea of participation in a liberal market becomes in kind.\n\nThe cries of central planning shall ring hollow for all to see as the socialists of old find their ideas increasingly left in the dust of rapid economic success. The radical formula for success disseminating from the writings of the Acton-Tocqueville Society may perhaps find suitable adherents across Europe's New capitalists. The state shall be the arbiter of the free market, with all of its dynamism, equality and vast riches. However, whether or not this so-called Neo-liberalism can navigate the precarious balancing act of citizens' welfare remains yet to be seen."
conservatism_oligarchic_conservatism_subtype_desc: "In the past, the people did not rule themselves. They were guided by the enlightened, the gilded royalty chosen by God in His almighty reason to lead them for their own interests — in the interests of others. As it should be. As it should always be.\n\nToday, the world lives in the shroud of a new order, one where kings and queens are consigned to the past. However, the men who move the levers of power have found new ways to guide the people to their preferred outcomes using the more modern methods of democracy. Even the regressive must evolve if only to efficiently control the state. Therefore, this new breed of oligarchs accepts liberal democratic institutions — preferably if they can maintain a firm hand on them. Their ideal state would continue the guiding hand philosophy passed on by nobility to oligarchy to raise the nation to a higher ideal for life.\n\nOppression and repression are tools alongside the institutions they inherited from their predecessors to hold onto power. Elections are no exception to this, but they will concede to a fair defeat if the pendulum of power sways away from their side, licking their wounds as they prepare to use all their familiar tricks to seize control again. Ultimately, they know they will never win the hearts and minds of voters. But when the moment of truth strikes at the ballot box, they know their voters will make the right choice in the interests of the state and nation."
conservatism_right_kemalism_subtype_desc: "In prior decades, Kemalism held an almost monolithic presence within Turkish politics, encompassing left, right and centre. However, in recent years, Turkey's left flank has steadily drifted away from Kemalism's desire to emulate Western notions of democratization, largely due to Kemalist prioritization of nationalism and lack of commitment on matters of social welfare and development. As a response, many Kemalists have decided to emphasise the nationalist aspects of their ideology and Atatürk's legacy, seeking to realign Kemalism to the right of centre, with a much greater commitment to nationalism. Emphasizing democracy and statism, as opposed to their more welfare-oriented left-wing cousins, Right Kemalists continue to espouse a national unity which contests to alignment of other more conservative groups."
conservatism_free_market_conservatism_subtype_desc: "By definition, the Free Market proposes the minimum amount of government intervention upon the affairs of the state itself, believing that competition and society self-regulate themselves upon its best possible state, as long as the state's hand is to oversee, not to steer. However, the social aspect is where the classical Free Market diverges from its conservative relative.\n\nFree Market Conservatism are those that propose lowering tariffs as much as they preach the value of the traditional family; those that propose lowering bureaucracies, as long as they don't put "troublemakers" in positions the state would dislike; cutting regulations in the economy while putting extra tariffs upon countries not "aligned" with their moral compass, most of the time at least.\n\nFor them, the freedom so proposed by the free market begins in the economy; for the rest, the conservatives clearly know better."

paternalism_national_conservatism_subtype_desc: "Nationalism has shown itself as the dominant force of the twentieth century, proving its strength against the alien institutions of Yugoslavia and the USSR. Therefore, it has become essential to strengthen the nation against the fifth column in its forms. To do otherwise would be folly, lest another nation becomes a historical footnote like Austria.\n\nFor the national conservative, unity is the goal. How better achieve this goal than to have the nation rally behind the greatest nation in the world — ours. There must be no quarter given to those who dissent against the state; there must only be unity. Tradition is held dearly to maintain a secure social fabric, only disregarded when adherence to it would ignite the fires of class conflict. Economic policies will follow a less rigid orthodoxy, taking influence from either corporatist, dirgist, or even free-market positions, sticking to whichever of these philosophies work as long as they do their part in eliminating class distinction — a rigid and elitist notion that only serves to work against the interests of national unity.\n\nWhile most governments under national conservatism tolerate or collaborate with fascism and fascist states, they generally view themselves as being above fascism, viewing the ideology as an affront to the natural order. Ultimately, despite its deeply right-wing beliefs and nationalist attitudes, it leans more towards conservatism than nationalism in comparison to its extremist counterparts. The only ambiguous link between the two remains their attitude to democracy. After all, when so many other countries have discarded their democratic trappings, isn't it a worthwhile sacrifice to protect your people's future?"
paternalism_social_nationalism_subtype_desc: "One of the most egregious crimes that man can commit against his fellow man is that of colonialism. To colonize a land, a people, and a country is to deny them of their right to a proper existence. It turns the nations that fall victim to it into husks of what they could have become, and it turns its perpetrators into glutenous parasites, incapable of proper social function. This state of affairs can be seen clearly all over the world, whether it be with the Americans and Europeans in Africa or with the Japanese in Asia.\n\nNo crime can go unanswered for too long, however, and the answer to the brutality of colonialism is the theory of Social Nationalism. It, unlike the nationalism which birthed the Reich and the Shōwa, posits that the colonized can become nationally cohesive units through the recognition of a shared struggle. Social nationalists do not argue that their people should unite on the grounds of their ethnic or cultural superiority, instead, they must unite to defeat their oppressors. Although social nationalism can use any economic system to achieve its aims, most of its proponents also struggle for the establishment of at least some form of socialism in their lands.\n\nIn the first decade following the war, social nationalism found itself crushed under the weight of German bombs and Japanese military exercises, but the world is changing now. If all the cards are played right, they might just be able to win."
paternalism_oligarchy_subtype_desc: "Oligarchy, derived from the greek words oligos, few, and arkho, to rule, represents a government where power rests in the hands of a small group of people. They may be separated from the general population because of their wealth, education, military or political control, or in some cases, a minority group that maintains control of the majority. This form of government can be backed up by law, either under the guise of an emergency or transitional government, or through illegal or secret means. Although some oligarchal states pass power down hereditarily, this does not ring true for every oligarchy government.\n\nAn oligarchy can arise from many different circumstances. For instance, over time power can become concentrated in the hands of the elite through continued enfranchisement of the upper class, until the wealthy dominate all aspects of government, either overtly or covertly. Or perhaps after a coup d'etat, a victorious general works to entrench the power of his clique or the military in general over the population.\n\nAlthough one oligarchy state can be vastly different from the other in terms of what group is in power, they all usually exert heavy control over the populace. Civil liberties are usually limited, and voting at any level is usually restricted. However, exceptions can be found in states where some form of sham democracy, whether a sham by intention or by effect, exists. These sham elections may allow for a veneer of democracy, but ultimately the average person has no control over their leaders."
paternalism_solidarism_subtype_desc: "Solidarism is the ideology promoted by the Vyatka-based National Union of Solidarists. Violently rejecting communism, it aims to provide a twentieth-century basis for dealing with present-day issues, rejecting a purely materialistic approach to socio-economic and political problems, and promoting inter-class solidarity, brotherhood, Christian tolerance, and charity. They also claim to promote democratic participation in government (with or without a Russian monarch), individualism, and civil liberties. Their end goal is to bring about a Second Revolution that is "neither left nor right but at the front" and will rebirth Russia without returning to Bolshevik or Tsarist errors.\n\nIts critics, on the other hand, argue that it displays a predisposition towards a corporatist organization of society and an overfriendliness to the prospect of a "temporary" dictatorship in order to bring about their desired "moral and spiritual regeneration". To these critics, solidarism is alarmingly similar to Italian fascism, as well as the corporatism practiced in Salazarist Portugal and the former State of Austria pre-Anschluss."
paternalism_dixiecrat_subtype_desc: "A Dixiecrat (a portmanteau of 'Democrat' and 'Dixie') is a complex description of the various factions and figures in the American South who were originally members of the Democratic Party, but who, for one reason or another, have fled to the National Progressive Pact as its right-most wing. Originally coined by a journalist during the 1948 Presidential campaign to describe Richard Russell of Georgia's States Rights' Party, it has now become the go-to term for the NPP's southern wing.\n\nDivided and highly fragmented on economic grounds, with many Dixiecrats adhering to either rural populist traditions of figures like Huey Long, Thomas Watson, and Benjamin Tillman, or traditional liberal or conservative economics, they are united in their dislike of civil rights and federal intervention in 'home affairs'.\n\nDepending on the candidate, the Dixiecrat base can range from white workers, southern industrialists and business owners, social conservatives, and the traditional agricultural barons that continue to control the South a century after the Civil War. Many are haunted by the stories of post-Civil War Reconstruction, and are intent on using their collective power on all levels of government to maintain segregation -- one way, or another."
paternalism_corporate_paternalism_subtype_desc: "Even within polites that operate for the benefit of its investors and corporate mavens above all else, most corporatocracies maintain the form of a nation-state for external convenience, its successes built on the back of its people - its 'employees,' bereft of a voice in the machine that profits from their labor.\n\nAn emerging heterodox school of thought among the corporate elite challenges the notion that capital should solely be an exploitative enterprise in opposition to labor. Proponents emphasize the benefits of stability over profit provided by reflecting the demands of labor in business decisions to a 'reasonable' extent, arguing that a content workforce is more productive in the longer term.\n\nWhile this model of industrial relations is not uncommon in capitalist societies, the unique circumstances of a polity centered around corporations inevitably means this economic theory carries significant political implications. The advocates of this theory envision a more expansive role of the government in providing public services to the nascent 'citizen-employee', in exchange for their labor and a continued acceptance of corporations and market forces dominating public life."
paternalism_social_credit_subtype_desc: "Social Credit is an economic theory developed by British engineer Clifford H. Douglas after World War I. In the 1920s, he argued that economic depressions were caused by arbitrary discrepancies between the market prices of goods, the costs of their production and the wages of those who produced them. Essentially, he noticed that businesses were arbitrarily selling the prices of their manufactured goods far higher than their workers could actually afford. Because of this artificial scarcity created in the pursuit of profit, the workers' lives suffered and economies were hindered by lower consumer spending. To remedy this, Douglas called for governments to distribute money, or "social credit", to consumers in order to close the gap between production and their own purchasing power so that consumer spending could rise and drive economic growth.\n\nIn Canada, Douglas's economic theories have been synergized with Christian fundamentalism to form a right-wing populist political programme. The Social Credit Party worships individualism and private enterprise almost as much as they worship Christ. They call for a vast expansion of the money supply through providing direct lines of credit to consumers and producers and decry the national debt as a tool used by international bankers to loot the economy for profit. While championing free markets, they are far less keen on free moral choice. They are rabid opponents of counter-culture movements and believe their conservative interpretation of Christianity should be upheld as Canada's official religion. Some members of the party even praise the economic policies of the Iberian Caudillos and the late Duce of Italy, and progressive Canadians dread discovering where Social Credit will take their nation."
paternalism_semi_constitutional_monarchy_subtype_desc: "As absolute monarchism has fallen out of favor over the world in favor of a constitutional equivalent, a different alternative has also manifested. While in most constitutional monarchies, the power has been delegated to officials, executive, and legislative state organs, this is not the case in a Semi-Constitutional Monarchy.\n\nWithin this system, checks on their power are few, and often symbolic in practice, leaving monarchs who wield significant power over the government, be it executive or legislative. Semi-Constitutional Monarchies have often been driven by monarchs themselves, who wish to moderate their image, and simultaneously not give up their existing power. While not as unrestrained as an absolute monarchy, there ultimately remains little in place that can effectively challenge them, leaving nations at the mercy of the monarchy they have no means of removing."
paternalism_peronism_subtype_desc: "As the world's attention was occupied with the fall of London and Moscow, Colonel Juan Perón magnanimously accepted an apparent demotion to the most recondite corner of Argentine ministerial politics: the Secretary of Labor and Prevention.\n\nThe move, however, was a calculated attempt to achieve Perón's overarching vision: saving Argentina from the spectre of communism, by ensuring that its working class and its trade unions would be integrated into the political system as an estate of the realm. In the course of accomplishing this, Colonel Perón's movement absorbed wildly different ideological currents: Socialists, Conservatives, Catholic Liberals, and Fascists; all congreated around the rising figure of Perón, and their views seeped into the virgin mold of the ideology of which he would become the namesake. Which particular facet of Peronism is most prominent on any given day is ultimately the Colonel's decision. Years of manoeuvring in and out of government have, however, distorted and stretched the definition virtually beyond recognition.\n\nInsofar as Peronism - or Justicialism, its technical name - still retains any recognizable characteristics beyond its vagueness, its exaltation of the unwashed masses against the decadence of oligarchy, its predilection for economic nationalism, and its adoration for trade unions, are just about all that remains. Of course, this raises the possibility that said characteristics, and by implication Peronism, could outlive its creator in an organized form, the extreme personalism of the movement notwithstanding."
paternalism_kemalism_subtype_desc: "Kemalism, as the name suggests, is based around the ideals of the Turkish Republic's founding figure, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Born as a rejection of the perceived backwardness of the late Ottoman period, Kemalists seek to create and preserve a modern Turkish nation-state based on six guiding ideals; republicanism, populism, nationalism, laicism, statism and reformism. Kemalism has historically held a tenuous relationship with democratic principles, having served the official ideology of both elected and unelected governments. The principle of Turkish nationalism has been increasingly emphasised in the years following the Second World War, largely as an overture towards the fascist powers of Europe, and a countermeasure against the far-right at home."
paternalism_provisional_government_subtype_desc: "The horrors of war do not simply fade away when conflict passes, they remain as scars, continuing to haunt nations as they descend to chaos and their regimes collapse. Emerging from these ruins is the provisional government.\n\nServing to restore order and the rule of law after extended periods of turmoil, the relative serenity that arrives with these temporary governments is often cheered on by the people as a soothing comfort in comparison to the near-anarchic conditions of the previous era brought on by never-ending war or the volatility and violence that comes with revolutions. The discord of the past is often discarded off in favour of renewed national dialogue, as the regime begins to define the legal structure of the subsequent permanent government. The regime partakes in a long struggle of rebuilding: reviving institutions eroded by neglect and corruption, clarifying laws; assessing the damage sustained by the nation, and both literally and figuratively dealing with the messes and troubles that remain from the former regime's administration through programs of political and economic reconstruction in hopes of restoring any sense of normality to a nation shaken to its core and its accompanying citizenry."
paternalism_right_wing_populism_subtype_desc: "Populism, unlike what some may think, is a two-edged sword. While it can serve the interests of the left by appealing to the common people's desire for equality and social justice, it can also be used by the right as a tool to get in power, which makes it difficult to categorise as a coherent ideology: however, one can always still try.\n\nRight-Wing Populism, as such, is an ideology with a few identifiable core tenets: first, an emphasis on an anti-elites rhetoric; said elites are portrayed as corrupt and greedy, and are opposed to the common man. Unlike left-wing populism, however, such elites can be used to represent national or ethnic minorities as well. Right-wing populism is also keen on giving out welfare to the people, at the cost of disregarding the wellbeing of the economy.\n\nRight-wing populists, while economically populist, generally take a conservative stance on social issues, and quite a few are avowedly anti-communist. Such a combination of attributes could be thought to be a recipe for disaster, but it seems that the tidal wave of populism has started its march nonetheless; and for now, God only knows when it will die down."
paternalism_anocracy_subtype_desc: ""Anocracy" is a broad term- one that can easily apply to any government anywhere around the world. The basic, scholarly definition is that it's part dictatorship, part democracy- but it goes deeper than that. Often, scholars will argue that it comes about as a product of interrupted or incomplete democratization- a formerly despotic or dictatorial nation, on the road to democracy, may be classified as an anocracy.\n\nOn the other hand, it may be the opposite- it may be a democratic nation that is currently undergoing democratic backsliding- a phenomenon that is well known around the world. From corrupt presidents to military juntas that allow certain elements of democracy to take place.\n\nThe length that anocracies survive heavily varies- they can be incredibly brief, as a nation transfers from democracy to autocracy or vice versa- or it can stall out, and remain in this state for months, years, or decades- it all depends on a combination of the will of the people and the will of the despot."
paternalism_left_wing_corporatism_subtype_desc: "Corporatism advocates the organization of society by groups on the basis of their common interests. The term is derived from the Latin corpus, body, and describes an explicitly collectivist system of thought. Its ultimate aim is the construction of a society whereby classes cooperate with one another under the aegis of the State, as opposed to the class conflict inherent in systems such as communism.\n\nUnlike with technocratic or fascistic strains of corporatism, Left-wing Corporatism cuts down on racialist rhetoric. It is happy to work with—or at least incorporate—left-wing elements. This could be out of genuine belief in the validity of leftist thought, or because the leader sees no other way to keep the proles quiet."
paternalism_transitioning_democracy_subtype_desc: "Democracy isn't just a political system. It's a societal attitude. As such, it must be grown, nurtured, and developed. This is the purpose of a Transitioning Democracy.\n\nIn this stage, democratic consolidation either hasn't started, or is in its earliest stages. Political and civil rights, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and press, are beginning to be provided, though usually with some caveats. Police forces and the military typically play a role in the power dynamic, often at odds with the civilian government. Above policies, the definition of a Transitioning Democracy is in its outlook towards a free, liberal future.\n\nThere are many reasons for why a democracy is in this phase. New officers reforming away from an old military junta, a long awaited revolution solidifying its power, or simply the old government pragmatically adopting a new ideology. No matter the reason, a transitioning democracy is a fragile bird, prone to break at the slightest of wrong moves. However, if care is taken, it can grow into a powerful force."
paternalism_paleoconservatism_subtype_desc: "Paleoconservatism, though an ideology in its own right, is also a reaction to the projects of other American ideologies. Whenever a liberal crosses a road to crash his cymbals for baby murder, the Paleoconservative pickets on the curb. Whenever a so-called conservative cedes a town hall's floor to a God-hating commie, the Paleoconservative puts his foot down and says "No. Not anymore." These determined men and women do this because the very idea of the American family rests behind them: a mother, a father, their two kids, and a white picket fence.\n\nThe Paleoconservative asserts that Americans have forgotten to act like Americans. Christ should stay in schools. Women should marry men. Wives should listen to their husbands. Boys will, and must, act like boys. Socialists should go elsewhere if they want socialism, for in America, people sing songs about freedom, not fake equality. The Blacks want the White man to spend his tax money on great big apartment blocks that bring crime to happy neighborhoods, but the Paleoconservative resists and says "Not in my backyard. You'll just keep asking for more."\n\nThere will be no foreign interventions because America should focus on America first. There will be no government spooks to take working families' money, freedom, or culture. But the libbers won't even give them that that. They'll rob them. They'll rob prayer from schools, children from parents, and all the pride from the greatest nation on Earth. But on their watch, so the Paleoconservatives swear, they'll never rob God for In God We Trust. America should rest easy, for the surging weight of history carries the campaigning families who hold their heads up high and sing in fearsome strains "I am for Mom and apple pie.""
paternalism_poujadism_subtype_desc: "Pierre Poujade, an ordinary paper maker from the small town of Saint-Céré, had had enough. Enough of the common man being oppressed by the greedy financier; enough of the sad, sorry state in which France found herself; enough of the anti-democratic practice of the tyrannical Parti National. Enough of all that! And yet, what could he do?\n\nPoujade, not being one to stay silent and take it, began to broadcast his message loud and proud. Down with the tyranny of global finance, and with their puppets in the halls of power! Down with big banking, and the judeo-masonic masters! Direct democracy now, by and for the people!\n\nSurprisingly enough, and despite what the elites would want you to think, the people sat, and listened. Tired of the Pétainist decay, and yet not lured by the false promises of the technocrats, they slowly woke up, under Pierrot's guidance, to bring him in the highest office of the land. The time for the New General Estates had come, at long last.\n\nNow, a hyperpopulistic coalition rules, coalesced in a personality cult around the one and only Pierre Poujade. For free enterprise, against global finance. For traditional values, against degenerate liberalism. For direct democracy, against corrupt politicians.\n\nFor France, and against all who would wish her harm."
paternalism_paternalistic_developmentalism_subtype_desc: "Unlike pure autocracies, leaders of Paternalistic Developmentalist regimes are usually democratically elected, honor their duty to their constituents, and recognize people's right to political participation. However, when it comes to the great crusade for economic growth, which would subsequently improve the overall welfare of the citizens, Paternalistic Developmentalists believe that they are justified in suspending the "political excess" of democratic governance or freedom of expression to maximize economic development.\n\nIn short, the legitimacy of an Paternalistic Developmentalist regime hinges on the leader's ability to bring constant economic growth instead of votes. If the leader became unable to deliver their promise, they would usually either be forced to step down, or to attempt to cling to power by writing their people a bigger check in the future.\n\nIn most cases, the latter option poses a great risk, as the only reason why the masses are content with the regime is the welfare and wealth for which they "sold" their rights. If the leader resorted to promising large, yet void checks too often, they would face challenges both from within and without the government, and would most likely be better off if they had agreed to a peaceful transition of power in the first place."
paternalism_herrerism_subtype_desc: ""In short: neither in the brown ranks of Nazism, nor one more star on the flag of any imperialism".\n\nBeing an Herrerist is not just following the path charted by Dr. Luis Alberto de Herrera, it means evoking the caudillist tradition of the XIX century. It means honoring Oribe's struggle against European interference in the Río de la Plata and Saravia's fight for political representation for the common man. Those who call themselves Herrerists are the eternal defenders of the Liberal Conservative tradition, so undeservedly besieged by Jacobinism. They are the true defenders of social justice, for their fight is the fight for transparency and accountability of the government, so used to stealing the riches of the rural man for its petty projects or to satisfy the bottomless stomachs of the urbanites.\n\nHerrera's followers are convinced they are true nationalists, for it is they who are against Anglo-Saxon infiltration of Hispanic culture, for it is they who defend the homeland from being turned into a vacation ranch for Americans. They understand that while Sovietization of the Americas is repugnant, fellow nationalists like the Sandinists are allies against the eternal enemy that seeks the unhappiness and subjugation of Latin America; the United States.\n\nBut the Herrerists are controversial among their opponents for their poor track record at respecting liberal democratic norms and barely hiding their illiberal sympathies. As with many caudillist movements, Herrerism shares the same weakness. For with Dr. Herrera buried and unable to guide, Herrerism is whatever the new caudillo says it is, leading to frequent infighting."

despotism_absolute_monarchy_subtype_desc: "Absolute Monarchism is an ideology defined by total control by a monarch and the placement of all other government authority under their oversight. Most commonly, the monarch leaves the day to day management of the state to their ministers, but any decision can be overturned or reversed by them. With a history extending back thousands of years, absolute monarchy is one of the oldest and most enduring systems of government.\n\nThe transition from antiquity to the medieval era across the world saw the control of monarchs diminished in favor of the power of the aristocracy, who in some cases had only a nominal allegiance to their King. As the feudal eras of Europe and Asia waned, however, this arrangement quickly began to change once more.\n\nAs kingdoms and empires grew in strength around the world, the powers of the nobility were increasingly wielded by the monarch and their ministers, especially in Europe. Even as the powers of European monarchs were curtailed in favor of constitutional governments, absolute monarchies continued to survive in much of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Today, in a world desperate for hope, some might seek to place all faith in royalty once again. As the great French King Louis XIV once said: "One King, one law, one faith.""
despotism_military_junta_subtype_desc: "A Military Junta is a government where the military has taken political power into its own hands without any democratic element. Often this involves a suspension of the constitution of the state, and the rights contained therein. This leaves juntas free to stabilize the country into accepting their rule.\n\nAn authoritarian oligarchic rule characterizes a junta, with power shared among military leaders rather than centralized in a single person. Sometimes, civilian governmental institutions continue to function as well, but with their activities supervised or even directed by the junta. Other times, the junta rules formally and directly, maintaining legitimacy through a variety of other methods, most often promises of future democratization or of reclaiming lost land.\n\nUsually, a Military Junta takes power by coup d'état, though occasionally military leaders are invited to take control in times of crisis. Besides an emphasis on military strength and national security, they tend to differ greatly in their aims depending on circumstance. However, among all juntas, one ideal remains the same: the soldier protects, but he does not serve."
despotism_civilian_dictatorship_subtype_desc: "Life without authority is nasty, brutish, and short. The past few decades have shown that democracy does not have what it takes to keep the peace and prevent order from falling into chaos. Freedom has been given its chance; more stringent measures are required.\n\nCivilian dictatorships usually operate under a thin veneer of respectability. These trinkets and baubles form the carrot side of the regime, examples of which include a dominant political party that serves as a means of control, a constitution either molded to the needs of the dictator or exploited ruthlessly by them to rule indefinitely, and codified laws used to maintain stability. However, these token steps towards real freedom are inevitably seen for what they are, forcing the dictator to use the stick to keep the nation in line. State security is vigorously used to detain and maim any dissent against the government. The rule of law is distorted, when not circumvented entirely, to maintain authority against threats through imprisonment, torture, and execution — all of these being acceptable prices to pay for order and stability.\n\nThese regimes tend to, but not always, swing to the right-wing when it comes to politics, favoring the maintenance of traditional values and a concentration of economic power towards a friendly establishment. However, these ideological elements are adopted pragmatically to consolidate power further, diluting and discarding them when convenient. Ultimately, while not established solely for powers' sake, most tend to devolve into abandoning the ends they pursue in favor of practicing the means indefinitely."
despotism_theocracy_subtype_desc: "Explicitly acknowledging a God or other such deity as their supreme authority, a Theocracy executes temporal functions through human intermediaries that are officially purported to receive divine authority or guidance. In order to do this many, most, or all of the nation's highest offices are occupied by clerical or religious officials, and state policy and actions are typically governed by the doctrines, beliefs, and scriptures of the religion that they purport to follow, whatever those may be or call for.\n\nInternally, such nations are often characterized by prominent displays of religious observance, parochial institutions, state or otherwise, and a high degree of religious participation by their citizenry, whether voluntary or forced. With regards to foreign nations, the basic cordiality of interactions on the part of the theocratic regime again depend heavily on the character of the religion in question, and on the proclaimed qualities of the deity that the ruling class claim to represent. Whether they actually do, or are only conveniently claiming to do so, is a perennial question."
despotism_papacy_subtype_desc: "Unique among many of its ideological peers, the Vatican exercises a wholly unique system of governance that blends monarchy, theocracy, and a semi-democratic elements into a coherent whole. The Pope is elected for life, though not chosen through inheritance or bloodline, by the College of Cardinals - senior bishops of the Catholic Church - during a Papal Conclave that convenes to choose the next Pope.\n\nUpon selection, the Pope becomes head of the Holy See, Vatican, and the Catholic faith itself, imbued with the authority of an absolute monarch. The authority the Pope can exercise is vast, and transcends traditional borders as Catholics live across the world. While this has little practical authority, it gives the words of the Pope more weight than many other heads of state, and few set out to antagonize the Vatican as a result."
despotism_interim_government_subtype_desc: "An interim, or caretaker, government is an intrinsically temporary one that exists in between more formally defined governments, whether those be the result of democratic elections, military imposition, or some other method. Typically rapidly formed in the aftermath of the fall of a previous government, however that fall may have been characterized, their inherent perceived legitimacy is generally low. Therefore, should they not be quickly replaced, national disorder and unrest is sure to follow.\n\nSuch interim governments tend to be relatively authoritarian even if apolitical, if only to ensure that the status quo as it relates to state institutions is maintained until such time as their successor is properly established. At the same time, they are very unlikely to possess either the political will, or the physical ability, to execute policy of any real significance. The nation, in essence, remains 'frozen' until the interim government is replaced."
despotism_colonial_government_subtype_desc: "The very definition of an empire is predicated on the idea of one nation ruling over others. Sometimes, local collaborators or noblemen are able to step up and help their new overlords manage things smoothly. But oftentimes, there may be a dearth of willing assistants from the local population, or they may simply not want to be ruled over.\n\nEnter the colonial government. Staffed from top to bottom by bureaucrats, magistrates, and governors from the mother country, they take no orders from those they govern and would be loathe to do so. Their justifications for doing so may be myriad: the natives are uncivilized and not ready for home rule, doing so will harm their ruling country's political interests, or they simply don't trust the occupied nation enough to justify freeing them. If the governor is not a military man himself, they often have a close link to the military anyway, since it is the only institution the government can fully trust in event of an anti-colonial insurrection.\n\nOpportunities for a native under this regime are slim and none; if they are lucky, they will be able to get a job in the government's rank-and-file, with no hope for advancement beyond the lowest echelons of power. That is why these regimes so often tend to inspire fierce resistance; lots of angry, disenfranchised and disillusioned military-aged men with everything to gain and nothing to lose make for a wonderful anti-colonial rebel army."
despotism_baathism_subtype_desc: ""One Nation, Bearing an Eternal Message."\n\nThe brainchild of Michel Aflaq and Zaki al-Arsuzi, Ba'athism is a revolutionary Arab nationalist movement, aimed at creating a 'renaissance' across the Arab world by means of revolution against foreign oppressors. Ba'athist ideology combines notions of pan-Arabism, Arab socialism, and secularism into an ideological platform that aims to mobilize and subsequently unify the whole Arab nation through revolutionary struggle, regardless of faith or region.\n\nThe Ba'ath party functions as the universal vanguard for the Arab nation, accelerating its development in order to bring about the renaissance into all aspects of life. Its ostensible goals are progress, liberty, and socialism as defined by Aflaq, within a context suited to the Arab world. Dedication to modernization and progress means that the party opposes not only foreign rule but also all the forms of feudal and noble reaction across the Arab world. Liberty in the Ba'athism sense does not necessarily mean liberal parliamentary democracy, as it may subvert the revolution, and socialism here substitutes the Marxist notion of class struggle for a national struggle against colonialism. 'Arab Socialism' is considered an important means of reaching the renaissance, but not its ultimate purpose.\n\nIn reality, the ideological purity of Ba'athist parties across the Middle East is incredibly varied and intrinsically linked with local culture and tradition, as well as an influx of foreign political theories. The policies followed by the Ba'athist movements range from the rampant militarism of some branches to promises of representative democracy and socialism by others. Their only common goal is the creation of a united Arab state, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf."
despotism_eurasianism_subtype_desc: "A focused subset of nationalist thought, Eurasianism is defined by its relation to the proposed Eurasian 'super-ethnos,' the ideo-social concept that the Eurasian peoples, ranging from the Carpathian basin to the Mongolian steppes, must unite into a single social and political grouping in order to achieve national strength and protect against destructive influences from without. Through both preparing for and actually doing so, the 'passionarity,' or overall drive, of this ethnic grouping will be maximized, allowing for greatness to be achieved on a societal scale.\n\nKey to this theory is the notion of the historical relation of the Russian nation to the West. Rather than endorsing the idea of Russia as a European nation, Eurasianism defines the Russian nation as one that, due to its relations to the Mongols and other Asiatic peoples, is fundamentally separate from the West, with Eurasian unity encouraged as a both a means of defense from Western influence and a means of cultural development and rejuvenation. Eurasianism encourages close ties between Eurasian peoples, strengthened ties with Asia rather than Europe, and strong rejection of both "parasitic internationalism" and European concepts which are deemed external to the super-ethnos."
despotism_corporatocracy_subtype_desc: "While private capital exists in a tense relationship with the public interest in every developed country across the world, in almost every instance the public interest remains firmly in control of the levers of political power, with corporations being just one of many interest groups. However, this polity's unique circumstances has led to this normal state of affairs being reversed.\n\nWhether by regulatory neglect, corruption, or deliberate design, the political role of the state in a corporatocracy is dominated by corporate interests and representatives. Whether they rule indirectly via bought men and regulatory capture, or more directly by the outright seizure of political power, a corporatocracy operates for the benefit of its corporate denizens, their shareholders, and investors first - and for the betterment of its people a distant second."
despotism_vanguard_anarchism_subtype_desc: "Freedom is something too precious to be in the possession of the people.\n\nVanguard Anarchism attempts to combine the decentralized anarchist society with a standard, disciplined army to defend the society, often with a central, dominating leader of that army acting as the final voice when it comes to matters of survival of the society. Supporters of this style of anarchism argue it is fundamentally necessary in order to prevent more organized and stable external threats from overwhelming the communes. On the other hand, detractors consider this a fundamentally corrupt interpretation of anarchism, as the needs and will of the people are often subordinated to the army's authority in the name of defense and protection, and even besides, the sheer amount of individual power held by whoever runs the military makes them little better than any other tinpot dictator."
despotism_aristocratic_conservatism_subtype_desc: "A state - be it republican or monarchical in nature - is not necessarily a democracy, and few socio-political schools of thought represent this idea in a subtle, yet insidious way more than Aristocratic Conservatism. A state so governed nominally possesses a constitution, and enjoys all of the structural institutions of a democratic polity.\n\nHowever, large portions of the representatives, bureaucrats, regional leaderships and perhaps even the head of state are under the favors, payroll, or threats of the "silent rulers" of the country. These could be nobles from young democracies or the old guard of a monarchic government, adapting seamlessly to what is just a more abstract court. Or they could be wealthy ranchers and landowners, making sure the taxation system and government projects don't hurt their bottom line, and ideally, even increase their profits.\n\nTo say that this rule has no opponents is inaccurate. After all, an opposition is essential to keep up a democratic appearance. But said opposition is either backed by different patrons or is neutered, having no political backing. Political reaction is the rule; for those in charge, the situation of the country currently is the best it has ever been. Whoever disagrees can be simply labeled an enemy of the state or branded a subversive revolutionary.\n\nAll men have their price, after all, and nobody understands this better than the true rulers behind the veil of this government."
despotism_warlordism_subtype_desc: "When people speak of power, they speak of man's control over the minds and actions of other men. Among the nations of the world, this control is often political. Leaders exert power through some combination of orders, threats, and persuasion, mediated through institutions that seek to restrain the real use of violence.\n\nWarlord states lack the interest and the capacity for such subtleties. Cruel and brutal, warlords are leaders of armed bands who rely on violence to exert power over lands ravaged by war or crisis. They terrorize civil authorities, plunder resources, and exterminate uncooperative populations. Those unfortunate enough to live in a warlord state are often forced to contend with marauding bands of fighters, unpredictable and unrestrained from the rules of decency. While individual leaders can have complex goals and motivations, the bloated military apparatus they lead tends to be extractive, seeking to enrich itself at the expense of others."
despotism_personalistic_dictatorship_subtype_desc: "Autocrats have come in many forms throughout recorded history. Whether ideologues or lawgivers, saints or tyrants, the greatest among them had something in common: a vision, pursued to the utmost with every means at their disposal. From the republic-turned-empire of Augustus to the continent-spanning revolutionary ambitions of Napoleon, the mark such individuals have left upon history is truly indelible.\n\nOf course, those tend to be exceptions, rather than the rule.\n\nMost autocrats have far less high-minded motivations. Forget ideology, nation-building, or anything of that sort. For these men (and occasionally women), power is both the means and the end; "All for me, and none for thee." Egoism defines both their rulership and their personalities. They rule not by popular mandate or under the guidance of a higher cause, but by and for themselves. Extensive use of nepotism, brute force, and criminality can make their regimes, no matter how unpopular, exceptionally difficult to remove."
despotism_partisan_movement_subtype_desc: "Freedom earned through blood is better than tyranny enforced through blood. That is the thesis of a partisan movement - if war is necessary to free their people from foreign occupation, then let loose its hounds and cry its chants. Besides a devotion to the cause of liberation and a general use of guerrilla warfare, partisan movements can hold nearly any ideology, be made up of any class or nationality, and can be organized in nearly every way a movement can be. They can fight in the cities, in the fields, in the forests and in the mountains. From any place a person can hide, a partisan can fight.\n\nAs the jackboot continues to press on Europe's neck, as the rising sun's rays of oppression shine over Asia, as the colonies of Italy languish under the Roman eagle, partisan movements have exploded in size and diversity to combat these evils. From the UPO in the Reich's "Model Colony" to more ideological groups like the UMAJF in Malaya, partisans across the globe continue their struggle. The oppressors will fall, the tyrants will burn, until the partisans reach the beautiful light on the horizon, the promised land they so desperately march towards. Hope for their people, who have lost it long ago. Justice for those that caused all of the pain and misery.\n\nAnd most of all, what every partisan fights for above all: Freedom. For their people, for all time."
despotism_national_catholicism_subtype_desc: "The intersection of statecraft and religion goes back for as long as statecraft and religion have existed. Since time immemorial, matters temporal and spiritual have not only existed side by side, but both have crossed over and influenced one another to degrees so profound that it simply cannot be overstated. In the modern age, it is no different with the Catholic faith.\n\nThe National Catholics believe firmly that the best way to run the country is in accordance with traditional Catholic values and the enforcement of such, giving them a distinctly authoritarian and quite conservative character in general. Rather than merely encouraging adherence to tradition and the upholding of values, rigid adherence is something that must be enforced instead, separating them from other political Catholics.\n\nRather than putting leadership directly in the hands of the faith as in the case of a theocracy, National Catholics typically push for a cooperation with another arm of governance that would allow them to enforce their laws more effectively. Usually, but not always, it is a military force that provides the enforcement part of a National Catholic regime, especially in countries where Catholicism is a dominant religion in the country's populace- and therefore, its armed forces as well. Such a thing is, of course, necessary to prevent any backsliding into decadent, depravity and entropy."
despotism_managerial_state_subtype_desc: "A Managerial State refers to a political system where the country is controlled by and serves the interest of a selected group of elite bureaucrats. The leader of such a system, usually a group of technocrats selected via meritocracy as opposed to a personalistic dictator, seeks to maximize the efficiency of the state apparatus by micromanaging every aspect of the society through the hands of experts. While managerial states are not completely apathetic to their citizens' demands and needs, those concerns for citizens' welfare are nevertheless a variant in the technocrats' formula. The demands of the citizens are heard and responded to solely for the purposes of preventing revolts and maximizing economic outputs.\n\nLeaders of managerial states tend to believe that the system they profess avoids the inefficacy of electoral politics and believe that experts are best-positioned to lead the country to prosperity. However, history has proven that they often fail to account for the unpredictability of human emotions, and such failure could easily lead to their downfall."
despotism_institutional_despotism_subtype_desc: "A person touching down in a country such as this might look at the assorted trappings of liberal democracy it keeps around and conclude that the government is democratic—but they could not be further from the truth. Far from pursuing democracy, Institutional Despotism aims to create and maintain a 'Perfect Dictatorship' that successfully convinces people they are not, in fact, in a dictatorship. As the new decade dawns, the most obvious case of this is the PRI rule in Mexico.\n\nIn this state, institutions are all controlled and subverted by a single, incredibly-entrenched oligarchical party or other such group occupying the political bureaucracy. Meanwhile, the government has dictatorial powers to enforce its will, powers enshrined in laws that give the state massive oversight and the faculties to intervene anywhere it pleases. Furthermore, even most of the organized opposition is likely directly controlled by, or a satellite of, the ruling party to give an illusion of political pluralism. Therefore, it is impossible to imagine their displacement from power without an immense broad-front effort directed specifically towards that goal.\n\nEvery action, inaction, use, and abuse is justified by a single unified goal or purpose inseparably tied to the ruling group or ideology—no matter how vague or logically incoherent said goal may become. The result is a despotism institutionalized and camouflaged, and a national ideology and civil society forced to revolve around an abstract goal absorbing everything that it touches—which is very frequently used to justify the self-interest of the political oligarchy that sits at its head."
despotism_aristocratic_republicanism_subtype_desc: "The national identity is a beautiful thing, one born from the fight against alien royals who seek to oppress the common man and enslave him to work for foreign capital. But in the hands of this common man, its flame has dampened as petty squabbles leave it cast in darkness. It now falls upon an almost aristocratic grouping of capitalists, landowners and political elites to raise the torch to new heights.\n\nTo an outside observer, it would seem naive at best and blatant contradiction at worst. To these loyal sons of their republican founding fathers, it is only natural that those who have benefitted the most from their noble sacrifices carry on the Republican Revolution. For only they can unite each member of society, regardless of class or creed, against their historical oppressors who lie in wait for an opportunity to strike. Only they can ensure their protection from famine and poverty, ensure the upkeep of a culture and language that have been stamped into the ground by imperialism and allow each citizen their stake in the land's national wealth.\n\nBut actions speak louder than words. The honeyed words of a landlord born with a silver spoon in his mouth have never put food on the table for a family of eight languishing in his almost-tenement domicile. Patriotic songs and dances celebrating ethnic massacres disguised as romantic strife show no love to the descendants of those survivors, alienated and targeted in speeches castigating them as parasites. These nationalists cast aside the concerns as minor quibbles of red rabble-rousers and enriched noblemen who have not yet learned to love the national unity of their sacred flag. However, as these concerns find a spotlight in the headlines of dissenting newspapers or interfere with the day-to-day running of government, questions arise over its power. Only time will tell if this unity will fix more divides than it will create."
despotism_islamic_nationalism_subtype_desc: "The Prophet Muhammad once said, "Whoever fights under a banner of foolishness, supports tribalism, or gets angry for the sake of tribalism, he will die in a state of ignorance," condemning nationalism as something to be left behind. But for some, their devotion to Islamism can not be separated from their commitment to the nation, allowing the two opposing forces to blend into one ideological cocktail.\n\nDistinct from other forms of nationalism that seek to weaken the importance of religion in favor of a secular identity, as seen in Iran or Turkey, Islamic Nationalism places pride upon their Muslim heritage as a core tenet of their national identity. However, while this may be one of their primary principles, it is not their only trait. Typically, these communities tend to be racialist and xenophobic, with ethnic and religious minorities not part of the ruling class being subject to discrimination, persecution, and violent repression. In these nations, the military holds a secondary reverence, viewing themselves as both the guardians of the nation and the shadow of God, willing and ready to exercise their ability to supersede civilian governance if deemed necessary.\n\nFrom more traditional Islamists, this ideology invariably meets the criticism that it goes against the fundamental teachings of Muhammad by professing petty sectarianism instead of striving towards a unified community of believers. However, these nationalists are content to rationalize their deviations from this doctrine, believing that their warm embrace of national identity is a far more authentic expression of Pan-Islamism."
despotism_technocratic_corporatism_subtype_desc: "Corporatism advocates the organization of society by groups on the basis of their common interests. The term is derived from the Latin corpus, body, and describes an explicitly collectivist system of thought. Its ultimate aim is the construction of a society whereby classes cooperate with one another under the aegis of the State, as opposed to the class conflict inherent in systems such as communism.\n\nThe technocratic strain of corporatism is explicitly opposed to unions, calling them a roadblock to true class collaboration, and traditionally right-wing in its implementation of policy. Rather than appealing to leftist strains of thoughts it predicates itself more upon traditionally corporatist ideas. However, technocratic corporatism also stops short of fascism; it eschews hardline nationalism as a cornerstone of its societal implementation."
despotism_radical_kemalism_subtype_desc: "The will to power gives the nation its strength, the great men and women of yesterday who gave the masses a reason, a doctrine to follow lockstep, heel and toe behind. The great man in Turkey is Atatürk, and like the great men in Germany and Italy, his vision inspired a nation and gave a society a united vision of what our world was meant to be. If the nation is to continue to prosper, his ideals must be carried out with ruthless fanaticism and without compromise to the little people.\n\nThe primary tool used in this war of will is the state, a spearhead in the assault against reaction and regression, assailed and condemned at every waking moment in our society's endless stomp towards progress. The party will be a phalanx, a vanguard of Kemalist values undeterred by momentary fluctuations in opinion, prepared to hold tightly onto the instruments of government for as long as necessary to prevent the revolution from being reversed in a foolish fervor. The workers will work for the nation, given their just rewards not for acting as a slave to servile materialism but as the fruits of their labor earned in a righteous devotion for the cause of strengthening Turkey against its enemies.\n\nIt is for all Turks, in all of Turkey, that this mission is taken for. There must be no weakness against those who undermine our hallowed national unity. The Republican ideal must be upheld to allow the white crescent to continue flying proudly in every corner of the country. And if these principles continue to be affirmed, the Turkish revolution will live for more than a thousand years, unstoppable in its march."
despotism_wang_jingwei_thought_subtype_desc: "Dr. Sun Yat-Sen once founded the Three Principles of People that guided the Guomindang since its foundation, where it called for the independence of the nation, eventual democratization of the government, and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare system that addresses each citizen's needs. When Wang Jingwei and his followers proclaimed their rival government in Nanjing against Chongqing's, it became necessary to them to propagandize their version of the Three Principles of People compatible to the Sphere's vision for Asia.\n\nAnd so was Wang Jingwei Thought born - an interpretation of the Three Principles based on 'Peace, Anti-Communism, Nation-Building', calling for corporatism within, anti-Western sentiment without, and achievement of national welfare via cooperation with other Asian countries, independent from any Western interference. Initially, Wangism is treated as none but a perversion of Dr. Sun's ideals, nevertheless within the Nanjing Government there are true believers of Wang's sermoning. Japan's victory in the Great East Asia War has made Wang's ideals be deemed appropriate and become more influential. Regarded as the pioneer of Asia, the words of Wang Jingwei even starts influencing other Sphere countries, where Wangism becomes more popular among populace and politicans.\n\nFollowing Wang's death in the late 1950s, many competing interpretations of the Three Principles of People began to secretly circulate within different cliques of the Guomindang. However, Wangism is nonetheless the interpretation that remains as the most influential among the populace; years of youth indoctrination, the initial economical growth under Wang's Presidency, and wide recognition of the Nanjing Government as the legitimate representative of China, have allowed the people to take Wangism as it is. Needless to say, Wang Jingwei Thought is seated firmly atop the throne of the nation's ideological orthodoxy in China - one that would take a truly alluring alternative to dislodge from."
despotism_chiang_kai_shek_thought_subtype_desc: "In response to the War of Resistance against Japan, the Generalissimo published "China's Destiny", seeking to reiterate the indispensable role of the Party to ensure national unity and resilience. The manifesto, drafted by Chen Lifu, was further redefined by the ideologue post-war and has been the basis of Chiang Kai-Shek Thought since then.\n\nAccording to the Generalissimo, the Three Principles of the People as promised by Dr. Sun will only be brought any closer to reality through struggle. Struggle permeates every aspect of life; survival in the proverbial vale of tears that is life is a constant struggle of mind and body. An individual must thus maintain constant readiness, and a state must regard order and security as its highest priority at all times.\n\nTo an adherent of this thought system, national weakness is the result of organizational and psychological weakness. So the people must eliminate individualism and accustom themselves to national consciousness and revolutionary doctrines in order to grow a sense of collective responsibility. The political establishment represents the united vanguard of society defending against the mounting national crisis. All the nation and classes must adhere to the leadership of this unified political apparatus.\n\nHeavily against Liberalism and Communism as 'the source of degeneracy', Chiang Kai-shek Thought emphasizes Germany and Italy as epitomes of a united nation, though downplaying their racialism. Also strongly emphasized are anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, suspicion of foreign influence, and a great emphasis on self-reliance in both people and country. Unlike in the Nanjing Government, the importance of a leader is neither embraced nor negated. Some Party democracy is encouraged to ensure the Party always runs on principles rather than on personality cults or factionalism—at least on paper.\n\nThrough these measures, the Generalissimo's remaining adherents believe, the successful realisation of Tridemism will be achieved. The result will be a revived nation and polity based on justice and order serving as a model of liberation for the other oppressed races of the Earth. "

ultranationalism_stratocracy_subtype_desc: "Stratocratic regimes are, in general, little more than a military organization expending the minimal effort possible to provide civilian state institutions, in order to redirect all that possible towards the military and military-related interests. They are, in essence, an army with a state, with every decision of policy ultimately, in some fashion, supporting military endeavors, and with nearly all actions underlaid by an ideological doctrine of rabid and uncompromising nationalism.\n\nTo achieve this, they are often internally characterized by omnipresent propaganda and the active promotion of nationalist thought. In addition, and in order to sustain their military administration, such governments typically display extreme aggression on the world stage, towards both neighboring states as well as those considered state enemies, for reasons of history, political expediency, or others as determined. This often results in the nation being in near-eternal conflict, armed or otherwise, which to its leaders and people is often a desired goal in itself."
ultranationalism_reactionary_nationalism_subtype_desc: "Reactionary Nationalism, like many other ideologies, emerged from the minds of the men who endured the industrial horrors of the twentieth century. When those men returned home, they could not reconcile the grand narratives for which they had fought with the reality of the world they had shaped. Modernity had conspired against them. They found no clarity of vision, they found no unity in strength. The romance of the soldier's return was a fiction. The romance of soldierly virtues was a fiction. Subjectivity usurped certitude. As time passed, there were more revolutions, more humiliations. More moralizing from materialistic creatures that could only breed in total vacuity. More traditions thrown to dogs. More suffering for it. More of the same, though without sameness.\n\nReactionary Nationalism proposes that nations must return to a past state of social organization in order to cast off the spiritual malaise enforced by twentieth-century modernity. This structure is typically picked from a narrow, romanticised slice of time in that nation's history, though it can also relate to methods for the violent transposition of antiquated moral norms onto colonies and other realms of empire. The policies born thereof are more frequently annihilationist than assimilationist, for Reactionary Nationalists believe that homogeneity is a prerequisite of nationhood.\n\nReactionary Nationalism is warlike and exclusive by nature. It must be, in order to satisfy the perverted heroism it proselytizes. Reactionary Nationalists believe that they seek justice by making the world as it should be, informed by the inalienable truth that some men are superior, and some men are inferior. But the lot of these self-styled knights is to fit virtues that never existed, or to force people who only know modernity to mold themselves into figures in gilded paintings. Starved of defined ideology, Reactionary Nationalism attaches itself to a superficial aesthetic, or the image of a knight in armor, visor down, and sword upright, so that any statesman may imagine himself as an emissary of return.\n\nBut the lie does not matter. The ideal unites. The romance unites."
ultranationalism_fundamentalist_zionism_subtype_desc: "The original objective of 'mainstream' Zionism, since the days of Theodor Herzl and Moses Hess, was the transformation of the Jewish people from the abnormality of the diaspora to the normality of nationhood, in their own land, with their own national economy, accepted by the world. While primarily a product of 19th-century Western Europe's secular Jewry, even much of Eastern Europe's religious Jewry had also accepted this premise. However, as Jewish settlement in Palestine began to rapidly grow during the early 20th century, a different view has emerged, particularly around Rabbi Avrahan Yitzhak HaCohen Kook and his son, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook. This view of Zionism, when taken to its extreme, reverses this desire for normality and instead offers a 'Zionism of Redemption'. According to Fundamentalist Zionists, the Jewish people are in fact utterly and permanently abnormal, since their covenant with God provides them with a destiny: to live according to the laws of the Torah in the Land of Israel, the biblical holy land in the southern Levant.\n\nWhile religious Zionism is a broad definition, with many different interpretations for Zionism, including pragmatic and tolerant ones, many of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook's fundamentalist followers see it as a divine instrument to bring about the messianic Redemption of the Jewish people and of the entire world. The greatest expression of this endeavor is the patriotic, pioneering, religious settler. This mission, however, can only be fulfilled by the liberation of the entirety of Israel, even against worldwide opposition. No sacrifice is too great in this pursuit, and any rejection of God's plan for the world, whether by Jews contaminated by the weakness of Western culture or by foreign enemies, particularly Arabs, is akin to suicide. Instead, the Jewish people must live truly Jewish lives and follow the divine plan of redemption, centered around the people of Israel, the Torah of Israel, and the land of Israel."
ultranationalism_stratocratic_corporatism_subtype_desc: "Stratocratic Corporatism is not, in and of itself, fascist. However, it does draw inspiration from fascism's tenets. This inspiration can be seen in its organization of society into a totalitarian, corporatist structure, with the military firmly in charge. The rest of such a society is mobilized to support the military, and by extension the nation as a whole.\n\nStratocratic Corporatism can also take on other characteristics beyond its corporatist, totalitarian structure. Such governments frequently, although not necessarily, include elements of racial supremacy. This is not usually done through the pseudo-scientific exaltation of a master race, such as in Nazism. Instead, Stratocratic Corporatist societies usually stoke their racial supremacy through invoking a national spirit or mythology.\n\nTo such societies, peace is merely an interval in a never-ending chain of wars, and therefore the entirety of the nation's physical and moral resources must be forever poised for wartime mobilization. These governments frequently grapple with the issue of how to take independently minded masses and get them to look beyond their own issues and instead towards an abstract "destiny" of their nation. Compulsory membership in patriotic organizations, mobilizing marginal elements of society into the workforce, and the constant need for "token sacrifices" in the name of supporting their ever-growing military, nothing is beyond the reach of such regimes. Such nations can not lose, and the people hold faith in their governments that such statements shall remain true."

fascism_statist_corporatocracy_subtype_desc: "Money can buy many things - towers of steel, cities of gold, the loyalties of craven men - but not a monopoly on violence. Or a country. At least, not yet.\n\nAlthough the role of corporate capital in this polity is monumental - entirely out of the scope of what would be expected anywhere else in the world - the state maintains its prerogatives. Though the corporations and their lieutenants are omnipresent, and their wishes cannot be ignored, their desires and machinations are ultimately subject to the whims and needs of a single primarch. Even if the economic and social life of this society is dominated by private enterprise, the political direction of the state remains firmly in the grip of a singular entity, bending the efforts of others to serve a purpose greater than mere profit. Here, labor and capital are both subsumed under the vision of their betters."
fascism_corporate_statism_subtype_desc: "Corporatism, from the Latin word for the human body, is one of the earliest economic models that presented itself as a "third position" to counter both capitalism and socialism. It is subject to a great many influences, from classical Greek philosophy to leftist syndicalism, but it was ultimately the proto-fascists who dominated the legacy of corporatism. It became deeply associated with Catholic and other religious traditionalism, integralism, and "clerical fascism" in the interwar years, and it served as a model to people such as Gabriele D'Annunzio, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Antonio Salazar.\n\nWhile corporatism is collectivist and believes economic classes are a fundamental unit of society it teaches that the greatest good can only be achieved through class collaboration rather than class struggle. Workers and employers alike are organized into some form of corporate body - be it guilds, syndicates, trade unions, or worker cooperatives - based on their industry, and it would be these corporate bodies that lobby the government on their behalf. The amount of representation the individual is afforded in the government is subject to variance, but usually often very little. Corporatism is also marked by a heavy preference towards a traditionalistic interpretation of the moral codes prevalent in the locality, especially with regards to marriage, sexuality, family structures, and popular media."
fascism_sansepolcrismo_subtype_desc: "Taking its name from a discourse held by Benito Mussolini in Milan's Sansepolcro Square, Sansepolcrismo is the very first incarnation of the fascist ideology, back when the PNF didn't exist yet, and fascism still called itself "Fighting Fasces". At the time, the movement's name and iconography were a tribute to the Arditi, Italy's elite assault corps and the very first to wear the black shirt - which would become the uniform of the future MVSN, the feared Camicie Nere.\n\nThe Sansepolcro Manifest advocated for a "Third Way" between capitalism and communism, taking the best from both sides while discarding what was deemed unnecessary. As such, early fascism conjugated private economic initiative with heavy state intervention in the economy, parity between sexes and worker uplifting programs with rabid nationalism and unbridled militarism, vote for women with single party state: a mèlange of political, social and economic beliefs, kept together by the messianic figure of the Duce, the voice of the people, who knew what was best for all - and had the strength to pursue it.\n\nAbandoned over the years in favor of less revolutionary policies that catered more to the middle classes, Sansepolcrismo has been brought back to the forefront of political discourse by Ettore Muti's meteoric rise to power. While unstable and somewhat erratic, it is undeniable that this ideology finds fertile ground among the lower classes and the military, making it a powerful tool to counter the advancement of socialism in society: only time will tell whether it will be successful, inaugurating a new age of nationalistic zeal and class cooperation, or it will once again be forgotten."
fascism_fascist_mysticism_subtype_desc: "Founded by Niccolò Giani, the School of Fascist Mysticism has spent years crafting a comprehensive analysis of both modern and ancient philosophy, society and religion. Constantly striving to find the reasons behind the great events of History, the members of this school came to the conclusion that matters of state, economy, religion, ethics and race are tightly bound: as such, there must be something capable of holding everything together, espousing the supreme good and fighting the supreme evil - and that something is Fascism.\n\nIn the eyes of Niccolò Giani, Fascism is more than a political ideology. Preaching eternal devotion to the State, unflinching faith in God, and utter loyalty to one's family, comrades and brothers-in-arms, it is a comprehensive code of values that can find application in every moment of a person's life, replacing all other social constructs, including religion: in fact, Fascism is the final and logical conclusion of Christianity, with the messianic figure of the Duce acting as paragon of virtue, and supreme authority in both political and religious matters - making the corrupt and decadent Clergy unnecessary.\n\nPreviously confined to academic halls and theoretic debate, Niccolò Giani's meteoric rise to power in the Italian Empire has seen Fascist Mysticism experience a dramatic increase in both importance and adherents, as its teachings offer hope to desperate Italians: duty in place of uncertainty, and devotion in place of doubt. As the faithful grow in strength and numbers, the Duce smiles, for every new follower is not only a step closer to what Fascism was meant to be - it is a step closer to ascension, in both body and soul..."
fascism_national_syndicalism_subtype_desc: "Despite what some may think, National Syndicalism is not exactly fascism, but nor is it socialism either. As revolutionary as it is anticommunistic, rooted in the writings of both Georges Sorel and Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, it is a very idiosyncratic ideology, merging various influences to become something wholly new.\n\nJust as its name indicates, National Syndicalism could be described as a fiercely nationalist version of revolutionary syndicalism. Seeking to organize society around a system of syndicates, and promoting class cooperation instead of class struggle, it aims to constantly revolutionize itself, which means that it is, at least in theory, deeply progressive.\n\nNational Syndicalism, while still fairly popular in Latin American countries and a lingering influence on Spanish intellectuals, is not as voguish as it once was. Indeed: times have changed since the 1920s, and what was once seen as a young, fiery ideology has now been eclipsed by other radical currents, such as national socialism or communism. Nevertheless, a resurgence, while certainly unexpected, still seems to be possible, for National Syndicalism's perpetual modernisation might turn out to be its greatest strength."
fascism_fascist_populism_subtype_desc: "Placed upon a pedestal stands the nation's leader - their smile comforts a people angered with the faults of modern life. A voice waxes lyrical on job security, wealth, and patriotism. To some, these words mean exactly what they say. To the person in the know, it says far more, speaking out on the rot surrounding society, whether it be liberalism, Marxism, or something more nebulous. But to both, the voice reassures them that only they can solve life's ills.\n\nThis kind of leader does not blindly rely on dogma for authority. As the armbands are swapped out for national flags, parts of fascism can be emphasized to maintain moral control, while other parts can be de-emphasized in favor of a vague nationalist fervor. Consistency is traded in for popular support, the currency used to buy their regime time to sustain itself until the people consider their leader an equal to the nation and see the two as synonymous.\n\nIn place of a comprehensive set of policies, they will often use bombastic and populist rhetoric touching upon real or imagined grievances, using charisma as a substitute for substance. This is often supplemented with copious amounts of corruption, backroom deals, and political stunts to disguise shortfalls in governance - the quality of which is meaningless to their supporters as long as they can hear their leader's voice reassure them that everything will be alright."
fascism_revolutionary_nationalism_subtype_desc: "Heralding a new era for the people now stood atop the shoulders of slain giants, a new wave of energy had emerged from the rotting carcasses of empires; a zealous 'Revolutionary Nationalism', materializing wherever the imperialist boot had once tread. Rejecting unequal treaties from London, resource-pillaging from Paris, and imperial diktats from Berlin, this newfound nationalism has roared in the shadows of Europe's empires to repel the horrors and brutality that had once emerged from the colonial office.\n\nMany of these post-colonial regimes govern underdeveloped and highly hierarchical economies as a result of their historical exploitation. However, authorities drive to modernize their countries, often unifying their people around a powerful figure or institution alongside patriotic, and sometimes revanchist, rhetoric. The newly-founded nation remains at the center of all political life; workers are instructed to toil for the strength of the country just as soldiers are told to fight to defend the homeland's recent freedom. Social views on morality and personal autonomy vary, but almost all agree upon a single, unified cultural identity in the face of a new modernity. As Europe lies fractured and limp under the grey jackboot, the liberated peoples cheer to celebrate independence from the masters who could no longer bear the whip."
fascism_revolutionary_zionism_subtype_desc: "The original objectives of 'mainstream' Zionism, since the days of Theodor Herzl and Moses Hess, was to provide the Jewish people with their own land and their own national economy, accepted by the community of nations. This was a product of 19th-century Western Europe's alienated Jewry, who had engaged in political action according to the specific necessity of a place to call home, when no one else would accept them. But with no clear path to this homeland, the movement fractured. Liberals and Marxists embraced Zionism on notions that democracy or revolution could bring about freedom. However, Revolutionary Zionists deny these Herzlian ideals, considering their adherents to be too passive, waiting for Israel without being willing to take action for it. Instead, according to their readings of the Torah and of history, the Jewish people are eternally betrothed to Eretz Israel - even in its death, it lives on in the blood of all Jews. No deed in the cause of Jewish liberation is too extreme, including bloodshed and terror, for the Jews yearn for the Land of Israel like one yearns for their lover.\n\nRevolutionary Zionism is highly idiosyncratic, with few common ideals other than ultranationalism and a call for direct political violence. Most Revolutionary Zionists are not religious in the regular sense, but their commitment to their romantic-nationalist readings of history serves as a secular religion unto itself. Most Revolutionary Zionists draw inspiration from the fascist movements of Europe- many are admirers of Italian fascism- but since the 50s, under the leadership of Israel Eldad, the movement embraced strong, homegrown messianic influences. Its partisans now believe it is their goal to reestablish a Kingdom of Israel, as defined in the Bible according to their unorthodox readings - a centralized and militarized state for Jews alone, with a new, Third Temple standing as a symbol for the triumph of the Jewish people."
fascism_ordosocialism_subtype_desc: "In 1847, Karl Marx shook the world to its very core. He created an ideology that discarded the old order, and addressed the true struggle of the common man. Now, Marx's true successor has arrived. Ivan Serov, creator of Ordosocialism, did not understand why one's patriotic love for their country must be at odds with their nation's class struggle. Why must they demonize the Germans, when their ideology clearly has unique characteristics that could better serve the forces of revolution? Ordosocialism is the resolution to these conflicting questions and ideals.\n\nOrdosocialism is the synthesis of the class struggle and the national struggle. Ordosocialism is the synthesis of all that opposes both capitalism and cosmopolitanism. Ordosocialism concerns itself with the destruction of those who decided to follow the path of reaction, and those whose reactionary tendencies are of a more... hereditary nature.\n\nSome fools accuse Ordosocialism of being a reactionary, corporatist betrayal of all that Marx stood before. Some fools accuse Serov of being a madman, no better than Hitler himself. These individuals attempt to weaken the revolution with their slander, and defend hereditary reactionaries despite their inherent opposition to the revolution. Serov and his followers will not let these false claims distract them, however, for they have a new revolution to bring forth. A revolution free of the rot that plagued its predecessors."
fascism_reform_bureaucracy_subtype_desc: "Like most great powers, Japan found itself deeply divided during the interwar period of the early 20th century. At the close of the Great War, it had been a mere 60 years since the nation had begun its transformation from an isolated, feudal society to a modern and industrialized nation-state. No such change would be without teething problems, particularly in the field of economics - after all, the free-market status quo had originally developed naturally, over a lengthy period of time, and the arrival of revolutionary socialism only complicated matters further. From a combination of that era's uncertainties, ideological experimentation, and the new experience of colonialism emerged a uniquely Japanese phenomenon: 'kakushin kanryō', or 'Reform Bureaucracy'.\n\nFor such an unassuming name, Reform Bureaucracy carries quite the legacy of cruelty and exploitation. Best realized in the ruthlessly exploited puppet state of Manchukuo, it is unapologetically dehumanizing, corporatist, and even fascistic. To these bureaucrats, economics is a matter of nothing but numbers and well-trained cogs, a series of gears dedicated to expanding the nation's preparedness for war and mobilisation. Drawing upon the 'total war' economy of the late German Empire, the economic rationalization of the Weimar Republic, and the planned economy espoused by many hardline socialists, Reform Bureaucracy's ultimate goal is simple: the complete subordination of the economy to the needs of the state, generally with the military and a politicized bureaucracy as the main benefactors."
fascism_neosocialism_subtype_desc: "The 1930s were a period ripe with unparalleled political polarisation emerging from the economic catastrophe that struck the Earth as a whole in the wake of the Great Depression. And it is from this state of misery and disillusionment with the traditional paradigms of political thought that the seeds of the Neosocialist ideological phenomena would first be cultivated within the rightist ideologues of the French Section of the Workers' International and the Belgian Socialist Party.\n\nSeeking to bring unity and tranquillity to societies stricken with dysfunction and chaos, the Neosocialists would reject the Marxist world-view and its theory of class struggle. Instead, the innovative architects of the newly-born Neosocialist Movement, such as Hendrik de Man and Marcel Déat, would nurture and advocate their own visionary theoretical conceptions of "Planisme" and the "Constructive Revolution" - a radical restructuring of society in a revolution from above carried out by a technocratic clique at the helm of the state through a mandate accorded to them by the masses. While it may not seem necessarily nationalist at first glance, the ideologues of Neosocialism with their autocratic bent and their flirtations with Fascist rhetoric and ideology would soon shift towards nationalistic attitudes as a way to bridge the discord that plagued their countries, thereby allowing them to make way for the technocratic, planiste, corporativist and socialist society that would follow the rigorous transformations arising from their revolution.\n\nWith the fall of the arbiter of International Socialism in the Soviet Union, it appears that the time of the Neosocialists is perhaps now, as both former Socialists whose world-views were shattered by the crumbling of Bolshevism and former Fascists disenchanted by the stagnation and despair enveloping the once-victorious Axis powers rush to its promises and the cures it proposes for their afflictions of cynicism."
fascism_integralism_subtype_desc: "There exist many variants of Integralism, often affected by the circumstances in which its exponents find themselves. Yet the core principles are very much the same, and have the same basis: that of stridently fundamentalist, traditionalist Catholicism.\n\nIntegralism rejects the values brought about by the Enlightenment - those of secularism, democracy, and liberalism. Rather than embracing 'progress' and change, an integralist go the other way, insisting that the only way for people to lead moral, dignified lives is through a return to agrarian medievalism, in a society predicated upon hardline Catholicism.\n\nBased on a corporative concept of the society working as a human body, integralism is not built on a concept of a glorious future to be built off of an ancient ideal, but instead on a ruthless, hardline attempt to bring that glorious - and usually imagined - past back, by any means necessary."
fascism_falangism_subtype_desc: "Born from the chaos of the Spanish Second Republic, Falangism seeks to marry the revolutionary ideology of National Syndicalism with conservative Catholic teachings and Hispanism. While retaining the anti-capitalist, anti-communist, inflammatory, and dynamic rhetoric of National Syndicalism, it is much more moderate in practice. Falangists call for the creation of vertical syndicates or trade unions to mediate relations between labor and management under an overarching corporatist, class-collaborative state capitalist framework.\n\nThe aspect where National Syndicalism and Falangism clash the most, however, is their social outlook. While the former advocates for a "Constant Revolution", the latter is ultra-conservative, calling for close coordination between church and state and a strong nationalism centered around Roman Catholic and Hispanist identity."
fascism_clerical_fascism_subtype_desc: "With enough faithful, no barricade can hold, no walls can stand. There has never been a force such as faith in history, capable of galvanizing the masses and pervading every thought. It is capable of changing behaviors, outlooks, and personalities. As omnipresent as it is, it is evident that religion will eventually fuse with the nation, forming a chimera of an ideology known as Clerical Fascism.\n\nThis ideology asserts that a nation is inherently interrelated with religion. The separation of faith and state is then completely erased, and policy takes a distinctly religious aspect. However, it is not a theocracy. Members of the clergy are not in positions of power, but the leader will be seen with high-ranking heads of religion. What organized religious movements exist will be subordinated to the state. On the subject of the history of the nation, Clerical Fascists will emphasize the deep-rooted links between the nation and religion, often glorifying religious and pious figures, like Saint Sava of Serbia or Jeanne D'Arc of France. These figures will not only be looked up to for their faith but their role in history. They will become political figures as much as religious figures as the state itself. Religion will become politics, and politics will become a religion. When one looks at Clerical Fascism, one can't help but wonder if this is the true purpose of faith or simply a transformation of religion into an insidious political tool."
fascism_british_fascism_1_subtype_desc: "The First World War scarred Britain like no conflict since the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the blood-soaked trenches of France and Flanders etching themselves in the traumatised psyche of an entire generation. As Europe staggered forth into an uncertain new world, it found something truly monstrous. And Britain was no exception to this dark discovery.\n\nUnlike its brethren on the continent, Fascism in Britain developed along two distinct lines. The more orthodox, revolutionary branch championed by Oswald Mosley, and another, far more idiosyncratic form of Fascism that germinated among the minds of the aristocracy and upper class. This latter form preached a distinctly British Fascism, one that would shield the Britain of old from the financiers, the Jews and the communists, and save the Empire from destruction at their hands. When German boots marched through London and sent out the call for collaborators to lead the new Britain, it was the adherents of this British Fascism who answered, and thus cemented their doctrine as dominant, for a time.\n\nNow however, British Fascism finds itself once more at a crossroads. After a decade of unopposed rule, the Uprising of 1956 rent open the divide once more as Mosley's acolytes returned to prominence, along with believers in a new, even more revolutionary form of Fascism. The Old Guard of the BPP however, do not intend to sit idly by as their resurgent rivals launch a counter-attack, and have rallied around their old leaders once again. The coming decade will see if British Fascism stands firm as a bastion of oligarchic traditionalism, cementing its place as the undisputed sovereign once more, or if it is toppled by youthful fire and vigour, its final followers its first, left to wither away and die forgotten."

Now Andrew Fountaine stands victorious ready to mould the shape of British Fascism in the image the party so desires. What that image is however is something that nobody can decide upon.\n\nBritish Fascism has abandoned the anti-Semitic and Anglo-Saxon supremacism that once so defined it, but what to replace it with? That is a question that the party lies divided about. The Fascist Revolution has triumphed in Britannia but now it lies trapped in a quagmire of its own making.\n\nOn one side stands Jeffery Hamm, and the men of Mosley's vision men calling for a Britain united around a leader, a singular man with a determination to claw out Britain's destined place side by side with Germany. On the other is John Bean and his dream of a Britain united around the nation itself, of a Fascism that lives up to it's revolutionary roots for the people of Britannia.\n\nUnity once the greatest symbol of Fascism has been tossed to the wayside as the BPP lies tearing at each other's throats.

fascism_social_credit_subtype_desc: "C.H. Douglas, in his description of a model of economics in which debt-free purchasing power is supplied to all citizens, viewed it as a method by which the machinations of "the inner circles of High Finance" could be overcome. Fascists who believe in social credit make the implicit identity of said inner circles explicit. They brand financial institutions, both domestic and international, as Jewish plots for dominance, and seek to overturn this conspiracy with the deployment of social credit.\n\nFor the social credit fascists, the influence of Jewish bankers begets the destruction of national traditions. Through their market manipulation, virtue is made worthless and vice made profitable; the people are thus drawn to abandoning God and Country in favour of aimless decadence. To these fascists, it is but another problem of artificial scarcity resolved by the distribution of purchasing power. By subsidising the righteous and making virtue profitable through social credit, these fascists believe that they can restore national values from the moral wasteland of modernity.\n\nTheir critics are many, and their points are plentiful, but social credit is still a young ideology on the world stage, its fascist child even younger. Time will tell whether their dreams can be realised, or if their delusional voyage will be shattered against the rocks of reality."

national_socialism_naturalised_nazism_subtype_desc: "National Socialism was born in Germany, forged by German racial identity and German conditions. A problem arose once that incredibly German ideology expanded and spread to cover most of Europe. Collaborators within Eastern European nations subjected to German colonialism struggled to reconcile their own identities with an ideology designed to subjugate them beneath the German jackboot. From that contradiction, Naturalized National Socialism was born.\n\nNaturalized National Socialism is not a truly codified ideology, and is often applied in a highly personalized, almost ad-hoc, manner within Eastern Europe. It is an ideology born from conditions forcing a bastardization of National Socialist tenets deemed incompatible, and lacks the formalization of the ideologies found in more established regimes. The core characteristic that separates the ideology from the standard in Germania is the supremacy of its practitioners' own national and cultural characteristics separate from Nazi colonialism.\n\nNaturalized National Socialism frequently possesses significant differences from the tenets that Germania attempts to enforce within its empire. Sometimes this is due to the practitioner basing their ideologies on a completely separate ideology buried beneath a National Socialist coat of paint. Other times, it is simply the result of the practitioner siding with their own nation's characteristics too frequently to be ignored, even if they genuinely seek to imitate Germania. It remains to be seen if these contradictory regimes will prove as resilient as the Thousand Year Reich." # Credits to the FtA team
national_socialism_palingenetic_nazism_subtype_desc: "Once upon a time, the National Socialist movement designed a revolutionary vision for the world, free of modernity's rot. As time went on, these revolutionaries grew lazy, bowing to petty parochialism and populism in the pursuit of power. In the world these men birthed, a new revolutionary generation rises, one that won't falter in the pursuit of national rebirth.\n\nNational Socialism is not a mere ideology for politicians to dress themselves in — it is a way of life. A true National Socialist is a soldier committed 110% to their revolutionary vanguard, using every waking moment of their life to change the present state of things. When the revolution happens, it will be total, tearing down each institution for a National Socialist rebirth. Every facet of their reborn society will be guided by political soldiers — models of the Aryan race — the new elite. National Socialist ideals will be placed on a pedestal, to be idealized above materialist or superstitious beliefs, unless value is seen in past rituals. There will be no role for the agnostic, no room for the apolitical, only the indoctrinated may wield any level of power to not contaminate this utopia with the decay that came before it.\n\nOne unfortunate barrier to the actualization of this ideal is that the National Socialist utopia each of these revolutionaries desires is a vision unique only to their heads, with millions of variations on every finer point, compounded by a lack of ideological theory. At the very least, all these revolutionaries can agree that no matter where they come from, they are all united by their Aryan skin. One day, they will transcend borders, joined together by the power of their race. And then, the revolution will be complete." #cuck neighbour: can you turn down the Death in June? me, trying to explode his head with my National Socialist rage
national_socialism_reformed_national_socialism_subtype_desc: "All ideologies that achieve power evolve as they rule, and Nazism is no exception. In its earliest decades, the arbiter of Nazism was Adolf Hitler, summed up in the concept of "Führerprinzip": the Führer's word is the final word, and Nazism is whatever he says it is. But as time passed and Hitler's practical influence within the party waned, he could no longer enforce his will as the sole gatekeeper of National Socialist thought. One of the people who took advantage of that vacuum was Albert Speer.\n\nSpeer's National Socialist praxis is marked by a watering down of many of Hitler's more unsavory policies. The meticulous racial quantification, the futile quest for economic autarky, the endless empowerment of the military, even the blind worship of Hitler; Speer considers none of these tenets to be sacred and plans to do away with all of them. These inevitably earn him derision from his more devout rivals: he's a revisionist, he's a factionalist, he wants to replace Nazism with weak and effeminate Italian fascism. Some have even accused him of being a crypto-democrat who wants to destroy Nazism entirely.\n\nWhat they fail to realize is that Speer isn't reforming Nazism to destroy it, but to save it. By making ideological concessions in the name of pragmatism, Speer is able to amputate the gangrenous limb and keep the rest of the body alive. By limiting rampant militarism, he can diminish the risk of Caesarism in the general staff. And by allowing criticism of Hitler, he can preserve a cult of personality while maintaining the appearance of openness.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, Speer can transform National Socialism from a bloated mess of self-destructive contradictions into a workable ideology while preserving its core. There will still be a one-party state, there will still be racial purity, and most importantly, there will still be one all-powerful Führer."
national_socialism_revolutionary_nazism_subtype_desc: "The actual progress of the National Socialist Revolution is a topic of debate within the Nazi movement. In private, loyal National Socialists often ask whether their ideology has gone far enough to reshape social relations. The typical answer is a stiff negative and a resolution to drive harder, to accept no compromise. The so-called revolutionary answer is to rage against the compromises even other Nazis make.\n\nRevolutionary Nazism is a tendency within National Socialism that advocates for an uncompromised ideological vision. The NSDAP would become the mobilizing force of a mass revolutionary-reactionary movement that would break down class barriers and completely remake social and economic life. So-called conservative forces would be destroyed and replaced by the Party-state; market systems, the Church and non-Party army and civil service staff would disappear. Large private businesses would turn to vapor in pursuit of the corporatist ideal, rearticulated and nationalized. The state-controlled corporatist economy, the Ständestaat, would enclose the activities of small and medium businesses and their middle-class managers. Every aspect of social and economic life would orbit the party-state, the subject and object of the National Socialist Revolution.\n\nRevolutionary Nazism largely died off after 1934. The Röhm purge and other developments consigned it to a seemingly permanent malaise, but Revolutionary Nazism lives on in a handful of fervent Gauleiters, SA men and DAF officials. Perhaps the tumult of the Cold War will give them a chance to once more command their totalitarian movement."
national_socialism_idiosyncratic_nazism_subtype_desc: "National Socialism is an ideology, a state of thought, and a state of life with the Aryan race at its fundamental heart and center. To subjugate the Aryan people to the cowardice of practicality or the confines of a German state is the height of folly. This is the National Socialist dream, and long has it laid idle at the foot of corrupt tyrants.\n\nYet the dream survives. Championed by the likes of Theodor Oberländer and Georg Leibbrandt, Idiosyncratic Nazism is a sect of reformist National Socialism committed not to the "pragmatism" of Speer or the degeneracy of the dissidents, but to something greater: the Aryan people. Some Idiosyncratic Nazis believe that many so-called "Slavs" have Aryan blood, others view them as a lesser - but not subhuman - race. Regardless, they all view the East as more than a massive slave pen to be transformed into Lebensraum. Instead, they see allies in the global struggle against the Judeo-Bolshevik menace. Many also advocate for a return to National Socialism's populist roots, and a re-centering of government policy around the Aryan citizenry.\n\nTo most, Idiosyncratic Nazism is a bizarre mess of contradictions, doomed to collapse under its own weight. To its supporters, it is true National Socialism, the manifestation of the People's Will."
national_socialism_technocratic_nazism_subtype_desc: "It is the opinion of some more activist-minded members of the Nazi movement that the whole constellation of social and economic life should orbit the Party of National Socialism. The Party, they say, should pull these spheres closer until they crash together and accrete to form a society that is Party, people, and economy rolled into one. But others — the self-described pragmatists of National Socialism — work to center the role of the State instead.\n\nTechnocratic Nazis side with the State in the State-Party diarchy, although the degree to which the Party ought to be subordinated is a contentious topic. Some argue for a return to the "looser" system of the 1930s and others for the Party as a purely cultural institution. But all members of this National Socialist strain agree that the State and the Party must have clearly defined, separate roles, with the State on top and the Party kept controllable.\n\nWith the supreme power of the State in hand, the leading figures of Technocratic Nazism would be more or less free to calibrate life as they see fit. They would abandon Führerprinzip in favor of an oligarchic cabinet of ministers, reduce the power of the Gauleiters, and purge the bureaucracy of careerists, corruption, and bloated institutions. They would invest in education and science. They would pass economic reforms to smash corporate cartels. And most importantly, they would capture the machinery of government in the hands of an educated class of expert and dutiful National Socialists. After all, The Thousand-Year Reich needs men who can plan a thousand years ahead."
national_socialism_spartanism_subtype_desc: "For some, National Socialism's success was forever enshrined by its triumph, and its failures were only due to specific misfortunes or political errors. They say that the Reich, for all its faults, is not in need of anything more than reform or rejuvenation. They would see the status quo continue in perpetuity, leaving Germany as, ultimately, just another empire.\n\nFor Reinhard Heydrich and his followers in the Deutsche-SS, that is not enough. It will never be enough.\n\nWhile the Himmlerites delved into esotericism, and the Waffen-SS betrayed their cause for wealth and power, Heydrich and his devotees already had a vision of their own, far different from that of the corrupt NSDAP and degenerate liberals. It was one of a better, simpler, more pure society of the ancient past, where men were warriors, women were mothers, and all traces of profligacy and weakness were excised. No cities bubbling with filth; no "pragmatic" mercy for subhumans. In barracks-towns and country estates, the pure race drilled for war and worked the land, while their progeny was honed to perfection through purges and bloodshed. They were the Spartans, espoused in thrilling tones by Heydrich as the ancient manifestation of Aryan supremacy - and when the world revolves upon the axis of Germany, even history itself will bend to the Führer's will.\n\nIt falls to the true believers of National Socialism - the SS - to realize the promised land. Infused with the spirit of Sparta and forged anew upon the anvil of the Volksgemeinschaft, the Reich will be made eternal. Even if the blood must flow in rivers and overtake the sea; if countless millions must choke and die; if the foundations of utopia are laid upon the mass grave of all mankind; it will be worth it. One has not the luxury of counting the cost."
national_socialism_clerical_fascism_subtype_desc: "Fascism is a truly malleable and fickle ideology by nature. Due to this, it has always been able to be adapted to fit the ideological needs and peculiarities of those wielding it even in the days when it was first adopted by Benito Mussolini. Given the widespread and still heavy influence of religion on millions worldwide, it is not surprising that many fascist movements ranging from the infamous Iron Guard of Rumania to the Ustase of Croatia have attempted to wield faith and Fascism simultaneously in their quests for power and control over the very souls of their nations. The resulting child of this often-grotesque pairing is known to the world as Clerical Fascism.\n\nWhile religious influences within fascist movements is nothing out of the ordinary, these regimes tend to be extremists on par in their fanaticism with National Socialism. They are obsessed with theories of "salvation" that are bound inseparably with race and the nation in the minds of its practitioners. Unless their vision of purity is achieved, warn these modern-day zealots, their people will soon find themselves damned both here and in the afterlife. Truly, is there anything as dangerous as those absolutely assured of their own righteousness?"
national_socialism_burgundian_system_subtype_desc: "When Germany's luck began running out after the Second World War, certain fanatical and unorthodox members of the Nazi Party - chief among them Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler - sought to reconcile their belief in the superiority of National Socialism with the increasingly bleak reality unfolding before them. They eventually arrived at the conclusion that the Nazi Party had lost sight of itself and collapsed into decadence, and that only they were fit to preserve National Socialism as truly intended. They quietly isolated themselves from the Third Reich's political structures, secretly building their own systems in parallel. When Himmler was made head of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgundy, he began implementing this purified vision of Nazism unimpeded.\n\nMuch like how many of the Reich's ideological goals revolve around Hitler's increasingly erratic statements, the tenets of the Burgundian System are rather ill-defined. The only way one could attempt to understand it is to analyze Himmler's increasingly inscrutable actions and cryptic beliefs, which range from vague and seemingly contradictory ideals of agrarianism and hyper-industrialization, to the establishment of a Germanic neopagan state religion and exploration of the occult. What is absolutely certain, though, is that his regime implements Nazi policies to a unique extreme: the SS is exalted above all other social strata, draconian racial hygiene laws are harshly enforced, and National Socialist theory is deliberately incorporated into every aspect of waking life. It also imposes an incomparable degree of totalitarianism upon the entire population, in hopes of removing all potential sources of decadence or complacency. Whether this has succeeded at all - or will do so in the future - is known only to Reichsführer Himmler, for while secrets flow like a river into the Ordensstaat, they are never permitted to leave."
national_socialism_imperial_cult_subtype_desc: "On the night of 17 July 1918, Bolshevik revolutionaries executed the Romanov imperial family in a cellar beneath Yekaterinburg. Their deaths ought to have marked the end of the story of House Romanov. Instead, Russia remained haunted by them. Through revolution, war, and dissolution, rumors spread that one of Nicholas's children had survived. As the country shattered, some came to believe that the Romanov children remained in hiding and would return, one day, to restore Russia to greatness. These delusions came to coalesce around one man, Sergey Taboritsky, and his imperial cult of Alexei.\n\nA shambling corpse of a movement held together by fear, imperial nostalgia, and virulent antisemitism, the imperial cult's sole goal is to hasten Alexei's return to Russia. To this end, supporters believe in mobilizing all resources of the state toward purification, hoping for their savior's return once the Russian people have proved themselves "worthy" of him. Advocates support the systematic extermination of Russia's minorities, enforced poverty of the mass public, and the construction of grand, imperial monuments. Their system of mass surveillance and extreme punishment is directly inspired by the purified realms of the Reichskommissariat Kaukasien and its leader Josias, a man Taboritsky openly admires.\n\nYet, the movement's sustainability is unclear. Every day that their savior fails to return, the cult grows more desperate. Soon, observers fear, there may not be a Russia for Alexei to return to."
national_socialism_rosenbergite_tendency_subtype_desc: "Within all movements, great and small, there are those who find themselves in a struggle against orthodoxy. Some are great men, struggling against rising systems of evil, ardently defending rights and liberties. Others, like Alfred Rosenberg, fought only for their own petty politics. Yet even years later, when the trends are clear and the dust is settling, their ideas, policies, and conceptions persist.\n\nThe Rosenbergite Tendency is not an organized movement, but a disparate collection of characters who, to one end or another, see the ideas of Alfred Rosenberg as the ideal German policy towards the East. To Rosenberg, a Baltic German, the East was more than a land to settle, but a set of nations to uplift and purify, to use as a wedge that can fully destroy the Russian nation. Though the man himself is long forgotten in Germania, his policies retain weight in the east, where his vision of the Reichskommissariats has not yet fully dimmed.\n\nIntellectuals and thinkers still heed Rosenberg's word, as a kind of pragmatic, humanitarian policy which might have prevented the maelstrom gripping the East. Yet make no mistake - its believers follow Hitler in every other aspect. They are as chained to the Reich and its violence as much as their colleagues. Rosenberg's word, no matter how sweet, is not an escape."
