 ### Leader Description ###
 POLITICS_ZINOVIEV_DESC:0 "Grigory Yevseevich Zinoviev stands before a map of Russia, his weathered finger tracing the path from Gayny to Arkhangelsk, a route he knows must soon run red with blood. The old Bolshevik's eyes, once alight with internationalist fervor, now burn with something darker – a nationalist fury tempered by decades of bitter lessons.\n\nZinoviev's story is one of survival through adaptation. As head of the Comintern throughout the tumultuous 1930s and 1940s, he maintained his position by navigating the treacherous waters between Trotsky, Stalin, and Kamenev. But survival came at the cost of watching his grand vision crumble. The Western communists he nurtured proved impotent against anti-communist sentiment. The Saxon uprising, meticulously planned with Karl Radek to establish ties with German communists, ended in catastrophic failure. Worst of all, the minorities of the Soviet Union – Ukrainians, Belarusians, Balts, Tatars – those he had championed as equal partners in the revolutionary project, betrayed the federation by collaborating with German invaders.\n\nEach disappointment pulled Zinoviev further from internationalism and closer to National Bolshevism. While Kamenev and his circle occupied the spotlight in Arkhangelsk, Zinoviev quietly consolidated power in Gayny, spreading his doctrine through local party organs. He courted the legendary Marshal Frunze into his camp, methodically placing loyalists throughout the NKVD. In 1955, judging the moment ripe, he denounced Arkhangelsk's central committee as traitors to the Russian people and raised the standard of revolt. Kamenev's furious response found him commanding only Marshal Timoshenko's meager forces – the bulk of the military had already been won to Zinoviev's cause. Only Marshal Tukhachevsky's intervention prevented Kamenev's complete destruction.\n\nNow entrenched in Gayny, Zinoviev builds his strength and nurtures his grievances. His speeches, once intellectual treatises on global revolution, have transformed into thunderous calls for vengeance against collaborators, incompetents, traitors, and invaders. The revolution he envisions is no longer an international workers' movement but a Russian nationalist crusade with socialist characteristics. 'We extended our hand to the world's workers,' he tells his followers, 'and they spat upon it. We defended the rights of minorities, and they stabbed us in the back. The lesson is clear – socialism can only triumph when rooted in the soil of Russian nationalism.'\n\nAt night, it is said, Zinoviev pores over military reports, his pen making careful notes on margins. His plans extend far beyond Arkhangelsk, beyond even the Urals. He sees a Russia reborn through fire, purified by vengeance, united under the red banner of National Bolshevism. And when the old revolutionary smiles, even his closest allies feel a chill. For in Zinoviev's smile is the promise not of liberation, but of retribution."
