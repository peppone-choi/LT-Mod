 SAM_gun_or_crown:0 "The Gun or The Crown"
 SAM_gun_or_crown_desc:0 "The halls of Kuybyshev's Samara government buildings echo with hushed whispers and tense silence as the long-simmering rivalry between Andrey Vlasov's pragmatic military faction and Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov's monarchist traditionalists has reached its breaking point. For years, these uneasy bedfellows maintained a fragile coalition under German patronage, each secretly plotting against the other while presenting a united front to their masters. But no longer. The time has come for one vision to triumph and the other to be consigned to history's dustbin. Will we embrace Vlasov's military realism and forward-looking modernization symbolized by the gun - practical, brutal, and essential for survival? Or shall we rally around Romanov's imperial restoration - a return to Russia's historical continuity, orthodox values, and traditional hierarchies symbolized by the crown? Both paths promise salvation for a broken Russia, but they cannot coexist. The future of our nation hangs in the balance of this decision." # 총과 왕관 중 선택하는 첫 포커스. 이 선택으로 전체 경로가 결정됨

 SAM_recreate_okhrana:0 "Recreate the Okhrana"
 SAM_recreate_okhrana_desc:0 "In the days of the Romanovs, the Okhrana served as the Empire's eyes and ears, its shadowy agents infiltrating revolutionary circles and maintaining domestic order through methods both subtle and brutal. Though its legacy is controversial, its efficiency cannot be denied. Our situation demands a similar institution - a modern incarnation of this once-feared secret police, adapted to the realities of our precarious position between German domination and internal dissent. The new Okhrana will prioritize counterintelligence against Soviet agents, monitor potential German betrayal, and ruthlessly suppress internal opposition to our government. Unlike its predecessor, however, it will avoid the excesses that generated popular resentment. This is not merely about state security - it's about survival in a Russia caught between vultures. Our enemies are legion, and only through vigilance will we endure long enough to reclaim what is rightfully ours." # 오흐라나는 제정러시아 비밀경찰. 독일과 소련 양측의 위협에 대응하기 위한 필수적 조직

 SAM_stolypin_reforms:0 "Revival of Stolypin Reforms"
 SAM_stolypin_reforms_desc:0 "Before the revolution shattered Russia's potential, Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin championed far-reaching agricultural reforms that might have transformed our nation had they been fully implemented. His vision - creating a class of independent, property-owning farmers with personal stakes in Russia's prosperity - was cruelly interrupted by an assassin's bullet and later crushed beneath communist collectivization. Now, we have the opportunity to resurrect this vision. By dismantling the hated kolkhoz system and distributing land to individual farmers, we can simultaneously boost agricultural productivity and create a politically reliable rural class invested in our government's success. The communists claimed to liberate the peasantry while enslaving them to the state; the Germans see Russian farmland merely as a resource to be exploited. We alone offer true emancipation - the dignity of ownership, the right to profit from one's labor, and the freedom to build generational wealth. This reform will not only feed our people but cultivate a foundation of support among those who work the sacred Russian soil." # 스톨리핀 개혁은 제정러시아의 농업 현대화 정책. 소련의 콜호스 체제를 해체하고 농민에게 실질적 자유를 부여

 SAM_volost_revival_desc:0 "The Soviet system crushed ancient Russian traditions of local governance under the boot of centralized control. Even earlier, imperial bureaucratization had eroded the autonomy of rural communities. The volost - a traditional rural administrative unit with roots stretching back to Kievan Rus - represents a forgotten chapter in Russian self-governance that merits resurrection in our new order. By reviving and modernizing this institution, we can implement a system where local affairs are managed by those who understand local needs, while the central government focuses on national defense and economic coordination. This decentralization will not only improve administrative efficiency but also build grassroots legitimacy for our regime. When people feel empowered in their daily lives, they become invested in the state's success. The volost system will create thousands of stakeholders in every village and town, each with a direct interest in maintaining stability against communist insurgents or German opportunism. Moreover, it provides a counterbalance to both Soviet centralization and Western liberal individualism - a uniquely Russian approach to governance rooted in our historical experience." # 볼로스트는 전통적인 러시아 농촌 자치 단위. 지방 분권을 강화하면서도 국가 통합성 유지

Yet now, we must turn to these same exploiters as potential investors and partners. This is not capitulation but calculation. German industrial expertise, technical knowledge, and capital resources far exceed our current capabilities. By carefully crafting investment frameworks that protect Russian interests while offering profitable opportunities to German businesses, we can accelerate our industrial development without surrendering sovereignty. The terms must be meticulously controlled: technology transfer provisions, training requirements for Russian workers, restrictions on profit repatriation, and majority Russian ownership in strategic sectors. Our factories will not become mere extensions of German economic domination, but stepping stones toward industrial self-sufficiency. We must learn from our occupiers before we can challenge them. Let them build the infrastructure that will, one day, support a truly independent Russia. When that day comes, these German capitalists may find their investments nationalized by a government they helped strengthen - but such are the risks of frontier investment.

 SAM_privatize_state_enterprises_desc:0 "The monolithic state-owned industrial complex inherited from the Soviet era stands as a monument to inefficiency, corruption, and economic stagnation. Factories that should produce prosperity instead generate waste, managers appointed for ideological loyalty rather than competence oversee decline, and workers labor without incentive to innovate or excel. This system cannot sustain our ambitions for a revitalized Russia. However, we must not swing blindly to the opposite extreme of unrestricted capitalism that would leave our strategic industries vulnerable to foreign control. Our privatization program will proceed methodically, beginning with consumer goods and light industry, while maintaining state oversight of defense production, energy resources, and transportation infrastructure. The process will prioritize domestic ownership, employee participation, and performance-based management. Special oversight committees staffed by military and civilian experts will ensure privatized enterprises serve national interests while operating with commercial efficiency. This balanced approach rejects both the failed communist model and the exploitative German economic domination, charting a distinctly Russian path forward that harnesses private initiative while safeguarding national security.

 SAM_national_agricultural_union_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector stands trapped between two failed extremes: the oppressive collectivization of the Soviet kolkhoz that crushed individual initiative, and the predatory exploitation of German agricultural corporations that extract wealth while leaving Russian farmers impoverished. The National Agricultural Union will forge a third path uniquely suited to Russian conditions. This organization will coordinate production, manage distribution networks, advocate for farmer interests, and implement scientific farming methods while respecting the autonomy of its members. Unlike Soviet collectives, membership will be voluntary, with farmers maintaining ownership of their land and produce. Unlike German agrarian capitalism, the focus will be on ensuring domestic food security before export profits. The Union will operate district-level equipment sharing programs, allowing smaller farms access to modern machinery without crippling debt. Technical education centers will disseminate advanced agricultural knowledge while preserving traditional Russian farming wisdom. Cooperative purchasing agreements will give even small producers leverage against input suppliers. Price stabilization mechanisms will protect farmers from market volatility while ensuring urban areas receive affordable food. Through this balanced approach, we can achieve both productivity and equity, technical advancement and social stability - a system that draws from Russian agricultural traditions while embracing modern innovations.

Our military's future must be built not on nationalist mythology but on clear-eyed assessment of what works. The German military system - with its emphasis on mission-type tactics, officer initiative, non-commissioned officer autonomy, and combined arms operations - offers valuable lessons we would be foolish to ignore. We will send selected officers to German training facilities, invite German military advisors (under careful political supervision), and systematically analyze Wehrmacht field manuals and organizational structures. However, this is not mindless imitation. We will adapt these concepts to Russian conditions, incorporating hard-won lessons from our own martial traditions. The Great Patriotic War revealed both German strengths and fatal weaknesses - their logistical vulnerabilities, underestimation of strategic depth, and inability to manage extended supply lines in Russian geography. Our reformed military will combine German tactical excellence with uniquely Russian strategic insight, creating a hybrid force that maintains Russian military virtues while addressing its historical weaknesses. We will learn from our enemies to better defeat them when the time comes. Until then, they will unwittingly train their future adversaries." # 독일군의 전술과 조직 구조를 연구하여 러시아군을 현대화하되, 맹목적 모방이 아닌 적응적 수용

For these nations, such equipment may be obsolescent; for our resource-constrained military, they represent an opportunity to rapidly enhance our combat capabilities at a fraction of the cost of new production. Through a combination of official purchases, third-party acquisitions, and discreet arrangements with sympathetic German officers, we will systematically import these weapons systems. While not cutting-edge, these arms remain lethal and reliable - Kar98k rifles, MG34 machine guns, and even early-model Panzer IVs can dramatically improve our fighting capacity against internal insurgents and potential external threats. Beyond immediate military utility, acquiring these weapons serves three strategic purposes: first, establishing repair and maintenance facilities will build technical expertise that transfers to domestic production; second, standardizing on German-pattern equipment simplifies ammunition and parts logistics; third, future requisitioning of German military stockpiles in a conflict scenario becomes more feasible when our forces are already trained on these systems.

Scientists, engineers, professors, doctors, and technical experts struggle to survive amid chaos or labor under foreign domination, their talents wasted or exploited by powers hostile to Russia's renaissance. We shall recover these treasures through a comprehensive campaign of identification, extraction, and repatriation - what we euphemistically call our 'intellectual reclamation program.' Special operations teams, working with intelligence assets and offering substantial incentives, will locate and extract high-value targets, particularly those with expertise in military technology, industrial production, and infrastructure development. These operations range from simple recruitment offers to elaborate extraction schemes for those under close German or factional surveillance. Unlike crude Soviet brain drain efforts, we offer these intellectuals not just security but dignity - the chance to apply their expertise to rebuilding their homeland rather than serving foreign masters or warlords. A nuclear physicist designing power plants instead of weapons, a chemical engineer developing fertilizers rather than poison gas, an aircraft designer creating civilian transportation networks - all contributing to Russia's rebirth.

 SAM_gun_victory_liberation_army_desc:0 "The decisive confrontation we all knew was inevitable has concluded with Andrey Vlasov's Russian Liberation Army securing full control of the government. The monarchist faction has been thoroughly neutralized - their leaders relegated to ceremonial positions or placed under house arrest, their military supporters strategically reassigned to non-essential posts, their civilian adherents quietly removed from positions of influence. This wasn't mere factional infighting but a fundamental clarification of our national direction. Under Vlasov's leadership, we reject both the failed Soviet experiment and the antiquated monarchist nostalgia that have torn Russia apart. Instead, we embrace a forward-looking vision of a strong, militarily self-sufficient Russian state guided by pragmatic considerations rather than obsolete ideologies. Vlasov's experience as a Red Army commander, combined with his ruthless pragmatism in adapting to changing circumstances, makes him uniquely qualified to navigate the treacherous path between German domination and Russian independence. The monarchists dreamed of restoring past glories; we will create new ones. They looked to dead tsars for legitimacy; we look to the living Russian people and their need for security, stability, and eventual liberation. The gun has triumphed over the crown - practical force over symbolic authority - and with it, Russia's best hope for genuine independence has prevailed." # 블라소프의 해방군이 권력 투쟁에서 승리하여 실용주의적 군사 정권 수립

Tens of thousands of our soldiers, officers, and civilians still harbor deep emotional connections to the Romanov legacy and Orthodox traditions of Imperial Russia. Rather than create martyrs or drive these elements into active opposition, we will implement a more sophisticated approach: Vladimir Kirillovich will be permitted to maintain his title, reside in an appropriately dignified palace, and appear at ceremonial functions wearing the trappings of imperial authority. He will deliver carefully scripted speeches written by our publicists, attend military parades, and bestow medals that actually come from Vlasov's authority. Behind this elaborately maintained facade, the real business of governance will remain firmly in the hands of the Liberation Army leadership, with all substantive decisions, military commands, diplomatic initiatives, and economic policies controlled by Vlasov's inner circle. The monarchists get their symbolic figurehead; we maintain actual control. Over time, this arrangement will allow us to gradually absorb the monarchist faction's supporter base without provoking immediate resistance, while simultaneously legitimizing our government in the eyes of traditionalists both domestically and internationally.

With the Soviet Union's catastrophic defeat and Germany's betrayal of Russian interests equally evident, the time is ripe to reintegrate these exiles into our armed forces. Special recruitment teams will target Russian émigré communities in Harbin, Belgrade, Paris, and Berlin, offering not just military commission but restoration of confiscated properties and guarantees of political rehabilitation. Of particular value are former artillery specialists, cavalry officers whose expertise translates to mechanized warfare, and the younger generation educated in Western military academies. Veterans like the aging but still formidable General Pyotr Krasnov, with his extensive combat experience and German military connections, will be offered senior advisory positions while actual command remains with Vlasov's trusted lieutenants. This integration serves multiple purposes: expanding our officer corps with experienced personnel, accessing Western military knowledge through émigrés educated abroad, presenting a unified Russian military tradition that transcends the Revolution, and signaling to wavering monarchists that their skills are valued even as their political ambitions are curtailed.

Yet simultaneously, we require international legitimacy and domestic stability that naked authoritarianism cannot provide. Our solution is a carefully constructed facade of democratic institutions - a Potemkin village of political pluralism designed to secure Western sympathy while maintaining centralized control. We will establish a Parliament with limited powers, filled primarily with Liberation Army veterans, technocrats, and carefully vetted civilian representatives. Elections will occur regularly, but candidate selection will be tightly controlled through registration requirements, security screenings, and media access restrictions. Multiple political parties will exist on paper - a moderate nationalist party, a business-oriented conservative faction, and even a closely monitored social democratic group - but all key leadership positions will be occupied by figures loyal to Vlasov's inner circle. Mayors and regional officials will be 'elected' from pre-approved lists. A Constitutional Court will adjudicate minor disputes while avoiding challenges to executive authority. Independent media will operate within clearly understood boundaries. This elaborate charade serves multiple purposes: it provides release valves for political tensions, creates the impression of popular consent, satisfies Western diplomatic expectations, fragments potential opposition into competing parties, and identifies politically active citizens for monitoring.

 SAM_absorb_soviet_bureaucracy:0 "Absorb Soviet Bureaucracy"
 SAM_absorb_soviet_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The Soviet regime, for all its ideological failings and brutal excesses, constructed an administrative apparatus of remarkable reach and thoroughness. From urban centers to remote villages, Soviet bureaucracy maintained taxation systems, industrial production quotas, agricultural planning, educational standards, and public health initiatives across eleven time zones. This administrative infrastructure represents decades of institutional development that would take years to replicate from scratch - years we cannot afford to waste. Through careful screening and selective rehabilitation, we will incorporate former Soviet administrators, technical experts, and mid-level officials into our governance structures. Each candidate will undergo thorough background checks, focusing on professional competence rather than past party loyalty. Those with direct involvement in political repression will be excluded, but the vast majority of ordinary functionaries - the engineers who managed factories, the administrators who supervised schools, the planners who coordinated transportation networks - will be offered amnesty and positions comparable to their previous roles. This pragmatic approach serves multiple purposes: it provides our government with experienced personnel familiar with Russia's complex administrative challenges; it denies these skilled bureaucrats to potential rival factions; it creates a constituency of former Soviet officials now invested in our regime's success; and it maintains continuity in essential government services.

While avoiding the grotesque excesses of Stalin's self-deification, we will systematically cultivate Andrey Vlasov's image as the indispensable leader of Russian resurrection. A comprehensive media campaign will present Vlasov's life story as a patriotic narrative - the peasant's son who rose through merit to Soviet generalship, who experienced the system's failures firsthand during the war, who made difficult choices to survive and position himself to eventually liberate his homeland. Portraits will appear in government offices, schools, and public spaces. Carefully edited newsreels will show him inspecting factories, conferring with military officers, and interacting warmly with ordinary citizens. Children's textbooks will include chapters on his leadership. Commemorative medals bearing his likeness will reward civic achievement. State media will refer to major policies as \"Vlasov's vision\" regardless of their actual origination. This personalization of authority serves practical purposes beyond ego gratification: it simplifies complex political messaging for a population with limited political sophistication; it creates an emotional bond between leader and people that transcends policy debates; it provides a focal point for national identity in a fractured society; and it establishes a clear succession principle in the event of crisis.

Our Educational Restoration Initiative will focus on universal primary education emphasizing mathematics, physical sciences, engineering fundamentals, and practical technical skills. Standardized textbooks will be rapidly developed, printed, and distributed to all territories under our control. Teacher training academies will accelerate the preparation of new educators while retraining existing Soviet teachers in revised curricula. Mobile educational units will reach isolated communities. Special attention will be paid to identifying and nurturing exceptionally talented students through advanced placement programs and specialized technical schools. Unlike the Soviet system, we will not waste resources on ideological conformity or punish independent thinking - our sole criterion for advancement will be demonstrated ability and potential contribution to national development.

While maintaining strategic oversight of key sectors, we must create conditions that attract both domestic entrepreneurs and carefully selected foreign investors. Our program will combine investment incentives with guaranteed protections - a framework that encourages capital formation while ensuring alignment with national interests.

For foreign investors (primarily German, but increasingly from neutral countries like Sweden and Switzerland), we will establish special economic zones with streamlined approval processes, profit repatriation guarantees, and joint venture frameworks that protect both their interests and our sovereignty. However, these enticements come with clear conditions: mandatory technology transfer provisions, requirements for training Russian workers in advanced skills, restrictions on foreign management positions, and performance benchmarks tied to export growth and import substitution. Certain sectors - defense production, telecommunications, energy infrastructure, and transportation networks - will maintain majority Russian ownership requirements. This approach represents neither Soviet-style nationalization nor unfettered market fundamentalism, but a state-guided capitalism where private initiative serves national revival.

One crushed initiative under bureaucratic control while failing to deliver prosperity; the other extracts resources and labor value while leaving the population impoverished. We will forge a third path uniquely suited to Russian conditions: the National Cooperative System. This model establishes sector-specific cooperative enterprises jointly managed by worker representatives, technical specialists, and state coordinators. Workers receive ownership shares and profit participation while contributing to management decisions. Technical specialists provide expertise and innovation without bureaucratic constraints. State representatives ensure alignment with national economic planning and resource allocation priorities. Unlike Soviet collectives, these cooperatives operate with genuine market incentives and performance-based rewards. Unlike pure capitalism, they prevent exploitation and ensure equitable distribution of gains. The system will be implemented first in consumer goods production, light manufacturing, and agricultural processing before extending to heavier industries. Pilot programs in textile factories, food processing plants, and furniture manufacturing have demonstrated productivity increases of 30-40% compared to previous Soviet management models, with dramatically improved worker satisfaction and reduced absenteeism. By harnessing both collective effort and individual initiative, the National Cooperative System creates an economic model that is neither East nor West but distinctly Russian - drawing on our communal traditions while embracing modern efficiency." # 노동자, 농민, 국가가 공동 참여하는 제3의 경제 모델로 생산성과 복지 균형 추구

The National Security Council, comprised primarily of senior Liberation Army officers, will exercise oversight of all significant policy decisions. Regional governorships will be assigned to battle-tested commanders familiar with local security dynamics. Critical infrastructure, transportation networks, and industrial facilities will maintain military liaison officers with executive authority during crisis situations. Economic planning will prioritize defense readiness and strategic resource development. This system acknowledges the reality that Russia's reconstruction is inseparable from its security posture - civilian prosperity cannot exist without military protection, and military effectiveness requires coordinated economic support. The military's disciplined hierarchy, emphasis on objective assessment, and culture of decisive action provide exactly the governance qualities our situation demands. Civilian technocrats will still contribute expertise in specialized domains, but ultimate authority must rest with those who understand that Russia's survival as a nation remains an open question requiring constant vigilance.

Cultural exchanges, academic collaborations, and journalistic access will be expanded to improve Western perceptions. Our diplomatic messaging will emphasize our government's evolution toward greater autonomy, our opposition to communist expansion, and our commitment to gradual institutional reform.

We require a comprehensive strategic framework that maximizes our limited capabilities through meticulous preparation, precise timing, and coordination with potential allies across divided Russia. Operation Revival will be our master plan for this eventual nationwide uprising. The first phase involves extensive intelligence gathering: detailed mapping of German troop dispositions, identification of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, assessment of other Russian factions' military capabilities, and cultivation of sympathetic elements within occupied territories. The second phase focuses on covert capacity building: establishing sleeper cells in key cities, pre-positioning weapons caches, developing encrypted communication networks, and identifying potential defectors from other factions. The final phase outlines synchronized military operations triggered by specific conditions - significant German redeployments due to crises elsewhere, evidence of substantial weakening in rival Russian factions, or confirmed support from international actors.

Literature and film will portray heroic resistance against occupation. Religious leaders will speak of justice delayed but not denied. This campaign differs from crude hatred-mongering - it is a deliberate cultivation of moral clarity regarding historical injustice and the necessity of its correction. Crucially, this narrative will distinguish between the German regime and ordinary German people, focusing anger on the system rather than indiscriminate ethnic animosity. The goal is not blind rage but cold, disciplined determination - a national psychological readiness to make sacrifices when the moment for action arrives. When that day comes, the Russian people must understand that they fight not from hatred alone, but for justice long deferred and a future secured against those who sought our annihilation." # 독일의 배신과 러시아 민족에 대한 잔혹행위에 대한 복수심 고취로 국민 단결 유도

 SAM_crown_victory_romanov_desc:0 "The ancient symbols of Russian sovereignty have triumphed over the pragmatic militarism of Vlasov's faction. Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, rightful heir to three centuries of imperial rule, has secured his position as the undisputed leader of our government, with Vlasov's supporters either pledging loyalty to the crown or being systematically removed from positions of authority. This victory represents more than a mere change in leadership - it signifies a fundamental realignment of our national identity and purpose. We are not simply creating another military junta or authoritarian regime; we are restoring the historical continuity of Russian statehood that the Bolshevik usurpers violently interrupted in 1917. The Romanov dynasty, which oversaw Russia's transformation from a medieval principality to a global empire spanning continents, once again stands as the living embodiment of Russian national destiny. Vladimir Kirillovich brings not just royal blood but legitimacy rooted in a thousand years of Russian history, Orthodox Christian tradition, and the mystical bond between sovereign and nation that no republican government can replicate. Where Vlasov offered expediency, the Tsar provides divine sanction; where military pragmatists spoke of tactical flexibility, the restored monarchy promises unwavering principles and historical purpose. The crown's victory offers something the gun never could - a direct connection to Russia's greatest eras of glory and expansion. Our enemies will soon discover the terrible resolve of a people fighting not merely for territory or politics, but for their divinely ordained sovereign and the sacred mission of Russian imperial restoration." # 로마노프 왕가의 복원으로 제정러시아의 영광과 정통성 회복을 추구하는 노선 승리

 SAM_persuade_liberals_desc:0 "The restoration of the Romanov dynasty need not signify a reactionary retreat to the failures of the old regime. Indeed, history teaches that the monarchy's rigidity and resistance to necessary reforms contributed significantly to its collapse. To avoid repeating these mistakes and to build broader support among educated Russians skeptical of absolutism, we will deliberately incorporate moderate liberal elements into our governmental structure. A carefully selected group of reform-minded intellectuals, professionals, and technocrats will be invited to serve in advisory councils, ministerial positions, and administrative roles - provided they accept the fundamental legitimacy of monarchical authority. These figures will bring valuable technical expertise, international connections, and a veneer of progressivism to our regime without challenging its essential nature. We will implement limited but visible political reforms: a consultative assembly with restricted powers, expanded local self-government, selective press freedoms, religious tolerance within clear boundaries, and modernized legal codes. These measures serve multiple strategic purposes: neutralizing potential liberal opposition by co-opting its moderate wing, presenting a more palatable face to Western observers, creating institutional safety valves for social pressures, and genuinely improving administrative efficiency through meritocratic selection. This is not liberalization for its own sake, but a calculated incorporation of useful elements from liberal governance while maintaining the crown's supreme authority. Tsar Nicholas II's failure to master this balancing act contributed directly to the revolution; Vladimir Kirillovich, educated in the harsh school of exile and witness to his family's tragedy, understands that selective adaptation is essential to dynastic survival." # 제정 복고가 단순한 과거 회귀가 아님을 보여주기 위해 온건 자유주의자들 포용

This fatal disunity must not be repeated. Under the Tsar's supreme authority, we will forge a unified military structure that integrates all anti-communist Russian fighting forces into a single, cohesive command hierarchy. The organizational nucleus will be formed from the impressive collection of experienced White emigré officers who have maintained military traditions in exile - men who served under the great White generals or their sons trained in European military academies. Around this core, we will incorporate Vlasov's pragmatic officers, monarchist volunteers from across the Russian diaspora, and even selectively rehabilitated former Red Army personnel who have demonstrated genuine conversion to our cause. Field Marshal Pyotr Krasnov, despite his advanced age, brings invaluable experience and symbolic authority as a link to the original White movement. His appointment as ceremonial Commander-in-Chief (with younger officers handling operational duties) sends a powerful message about historical continuity. The reintroduction of Imperial military protocols, uniforms, rank structures, and regimental traditions will reinforce this connection to Russia's martial heritage. Training academies will instill not just technical skills but the spiritual values that animated the White cause - Orthodox faith, monarchist loyalty, and Russian nationalism. This army will not be merely a fighting force but a living embodiment of the Russia that should have been, had the Revolution never occurred - now reborn to reclaim its interrupted destiny." # 내전 시기 분열되었던 백군 세력을 차르의 권위 아래 단일 지휘체계로 통합

 SAM_tsar_sanctity_desc:0 "The Soviet regime's most destructive legacy was not economic but spiritual - the deliberate severing of the mystical bond between the Russian people, their Orthodox faith, and their divinely appointed sovereign. For centuries, the Tsar served not merely as a political ruler but as God's anointed representative, a living icon of divine authority whose very person was sacred. This transcendent dimension of monarchy cannot be replicated by secular governments, regardless of their practical effectiveness. We must systematically reestablish this sacred understanding through comprehensive religious and cultural initiatives. The Russian Orthodox Church, our essential partner in restoration, will reintroduce traditional ceremonies venerating the monarch: special liturgical commemorations, prayers for the Imperial family in all services, and eventually a formal coronation ceremony with full religious significance. Educational materials will emphasize the religious foundations of tsarist authority, explaining concepts like the symphony of powers between church and state. Cultural productions - literature, art, music, and theater - will depict the spiritual dimension of monarchy through historical and religious themes. Vladimir Kirillovich will participate in highly visible religious observances, pilgrimages to holy sites, and ceremonial blessings by church hierarchs. Beyond public ceremonies, we will cultivate a deeper transformation in popular consciousness through community-level engagement: parish priests explaining monarchical theology, religious schools teaching imperial history, and local celebrations of tsarist religious holidays. This campaign operates at multiple levels simultaneously - intellectual justification for the educated classes, emotional resonance for the common people, and spiritual legitimation for the regime itself. By restoring the sacred dimension of monarchy, we address not just political arrangements but the Russian soul's deepest needs for divine order made manifest in human authority." # 차르의 신성성과 종교적 권위를 강조하여 러시아 정교회와의 연계 강화

 SAM_new_constitution_desc:0 "The restoration of monarchical rule need not mean regression to outdated models of governance. Drawing lessons from the failures of the 1906 constitution while preserving the essential supremacy of imperial authority, we will establish a new constitutional framework appropriate for modern Russia. This document will delineate a governmental structure that balances traditional principles with practical necessities: the Tsar remains supreme sovereign with extensive powers over foreign affairs, military matters, and senior appointments; an Imperial Council comprised of aristocracy, clergy, and distinguished service members provides strategic guidance; a State Duma with carefully regulated elections represents broader interests within defined parameters; a modernized judiciary administers consistent justice while respecting imperial prerogatives. This constitution differs fundamentally from Western liberal models - it does not derive authority from popular sovereignty but from divine right channeled through historical Russian institutions. Nevertheless, it incorporates practical governance mechanisms that address weaknesses in previous imperial administration: clear lines of ministerial responsibility, protection against bureaucratic overreach, recognition of local self-government within centralized parameters, and legal protections for basic personal liberties compatible with Orthodox values. The drafting process itself will be symbolic - juridical experts and conservative intellectuals will prepare technical provisions, church authorities will ensure compatibility with Orthodox principles, and the Tsar will personally review and promulgate the final document as an act of sovereign grace rather than submission to popular demand. This constitution represents not a limitation on monarchical authority but its adaptation to contemporary conditions - preserving the essence of autocracy while implementing the administrative structures necessary for effective modern governance." # 차르의 권위는 유지하면서도 1906년 헌법보다 현대적인 통치체제 구축

 SAM_establish_temporary_dictatorship:0 "Establish Temporary Dictatorship"
 SAM_establish_temporary_dictatorship_desc:0 "Russia's extraordinary circumstances - a shattered nation surrounded by predatory powers and internal divisions - demand governance measures beyond normal constitutional arrangements. Following historical precedents where Russian sovereigns assumed emergency powers during existential crises, Vladimir Kirillovich will implement a period of enhanced monarchical authority termed the 'Regency of Restoration.' This carefully framed temporary dictatorship concentrates decision-making power directly in the Tsar's hands, bypassing institutional constraints that might impede rapid action. All ministerial appointments, legislative initiatives, military commands, and diplomatic decisions will require direct imperial approval. Regional governors will be replaced with personally loyal military commanders responsible directly to the crown. Economic planning will proceed through emergency decrees rather than standard legislative processes. Civil liberties will be selectively suspended where necessary for security operations. Public assembly will require prior authorization. Press censorship will be significantly tightened. A special tribunal system will expedite judgments in cases affecting state security. While explicitly temporary, this arrangement establishes no fixed expiration date - the emergency powers will continue until the Tsar determines that Russia has achieved sufficient stability and security to permit gradual normalization. This framework differs from crude military dictatorship by maintaining the spiritual and historical legitimacy of monarchical rule, presenting enhanced authority not as revolutionary usurpation but as the traditional prerogative of the sovereign during national crisis. The Russian people will understand that these measures represent not tyrannical ambition but paternal necessity - a father taking firm control during family emergency.

 SAM_peoples_cooperative:0 "People's Cooperative"
 SAM_peoples_cooperative_desc:0 "The economic doctrines that have dominated recent Russian history - Soviet communism and Western capitalism - represent foreign impositions incompatible with our authentic national traditions. Pre-revolutionary Russia developed distinctive economic arrangements that balanced hierarchical order with communal responsibility, models cruelly disrupted by the Bolshevik catastrophe. Our 'People's Cooperative' system will resurrect and modernize these traditional Russian approaches to economic organization. At its foundation lies a corporatist structure where economic sectors are organized into formal associations (reminiscent of medieval guilds but adapted to industrial conditions) comprising employers, workers, technical specialists, and state representatives. These corporations negotiate internal standards, coordinate production, manage apprenticeship programs, and resolve disputes according to their specific industry needs. Above them, an Economic Council with representation from all sectors harmonizes cross-industry policies under imperial guidance. This system rejects both the soulless individualism of capitalism and the dehumanizing collectivism of communism, instead recognizing the organic interdependence of all economic classes within the national community. Workers receive fair compensation, welfare protections, and dignified conditions without class warfare rhetoric. Employers maintain operational control and profit incentives while acknowledging responsibilities to their workforce and the broader society. The aristocracy contributes investment capital and strategic leadership. The state ensures alignment with national priorities without micromanaging daily operations. This arrangement reflects traditional Russian social philosophy where each estate performs its proper function in a harmonious whole under sovereign guidance.

Our comprehensive support program targets emerging Russian businesses across multiple sectors: retail operations, light manufacturing, agricultural processing, construction, and professional services. Financial assistance will flow through a newly established Imperial Development Bank offering favorable terms to qualified Russian entrepreneurs - low-interest loans, simplified collateral requirements, and flexible repayment schedules during initial growth phases. Regulatory preferences will include expedited permit processes, reduced paperwork burdens, and grace periods for full compliance with non-safety regulations. Tax incentives will feature graduated rates that increase only as businesses establish profitability, along with deductions for capital investments, research activities, and employee training. Technical support services will provide consulting, market intelligence, and modernization guidance through regional business development centers staffed by experts in various industries. Throughout these initiatives, preference will be given to businesses employing traditional Russian methods, producing culturally significant goods, or operating in regions requiring economic revitalization. These businesses serve multiple national purposes beyond mere economic activity: they create employment opportunities independent of foreign control, develop management talent for larger enterprises, establish supply chains resistant to external pressure, build a tax base for governmental operations, and foster a middle class with direct stake in national stability.

The revised curriculum balances classical humanities with practical sciences: Orthodox religious instruction returns as a core subject alongside literature, history, mathematics, and natural sciences. Russian historical education emphasizes national continuity, monarchical achievements, and cultural distinctiveness rather than class conflict narratives. Literary studies center on the great works of Russian civilization alongside carefully selected Western classics compatible with our values. Scientific education maintains rigorous standards while incorporating philosophical frameworks acknowledging divine order in natural law. Beyond content, the structural organization will balance centralized standards with local implementation: the Ministry of Education establishes core requirements and approves textbooks; regional authorities adapt specific content to reflect local traditions; and individual schools receive limited autonomy in pedagogical methods. Teacher training institutes will be purged of Marxist influences and reconstructed with emphasis on both academic excellence and moral character formation. Special attention will be devoted to identifying and nurturing exceptionally talented students through selective academies preparing future leadership cadres, while vocational education receives renewed emphasis through apprenticeship programs coordinated with the People's Cooperative economic system. This comprehensive reformation serves not merely practical economic needs but Russia's spiritual resurrection - forming citizens who understand their place in the divine and historical order, who possess both technical competence and moral virtue, who grasp their responsibilities to church, sovereign, and nation." # 소련의 무신론적 교육을 청산하고 전통적 가치와 현대 과학을 조화시킨 교육 체계 구축

This strategy draws on Russia's historical experience weathering Mongol domination while preserving its essential character and preparing for eventual liberation. Several practical measures will make this extended submission both tolerable and temporary: diplomatic communications will emphasize our special historical relationship rather than subordination; economic agreements will be renegotiated toward gradually more favorable terms; cultural exchanges will be promoted to humanize relations; and internal messaging will frame German cooperation as a regrettable necessity rather than ideological alignment. Throughout this period, we will meticulously document German abuses, territorial impositions, and exploitative practices - creating a comprehensive record justifying eventual assertion of full sovereignty when circumstances permit. Our intelligence services will develop detailed assessment of German strengths, weaknesses, and internal divisions to identify potential leverage points. Military planning will prepare contingencies for rapid pivoting from cooperation to neutrality or even opposition should German power suddenly diminish through internal crisis or external conflict. This approach requires extraordinary discipline and patience - maintaining dignity within dependency, preserving core sovereignty while acknowledging temporary constraints, and never allowing tactical accommodation to become strategic acceptance of permanent subordination.

Moscow - the Third Rome, ancient seat of tsarist power, heart of historical Russia - beckons from beneath its German and Soviet desecrations. Our liberation requires not merely aspiration but methodical preparation for the moment when decisive action becomes possible. Operation Imperial Restoration represents our comprehensive strategic framework for this eventual nationwide campaign. The plan unfolds across multiple preparatory phases: first, intensive intelligence collection mapping German military dispositions, identifying potential allies among Russian factions, and assessing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities; second, covert capability development including sleeper networks in major cities, hidden arms caches, and communications infrastructure resistant to interdiction; third, diplomatic groundwork exploring potential international support or at minimum neutrality during operations. The operational concept itself centers on exploiting specific trigger conditions: significant German force redeployments due to crises elsewhere, evidence of substantial internal Reich instability, confirmed willingness of major Russian factions to coordinate anti-German actions, or verified Western material support. The military campaign envisions synchronized offensives combining conventional forces, partisan operations, and psychological warfare components designed to trigger cascading German withdrawals rather than decisive battlefield engagements beyond our capacity. Supporting elements include political warfare targeting German-allied Russian administrators, economic measures securing critical resources, and legitimacy operations emphasizing restoration of historical Russian authority rather than conquest. This planning process remains our most closely guarded secret, with components compartmentalized on strict need-to-know basis and full operational details known only to the Tsar and his most trusted military advisors.

These warrior communities were specifically targeted for destruction by the Bolsheviks, who recognized their unwavering monarchist sympathies and military potential. Scattered by revolution, civil war, and German occupation, Cossack communities nonetheless survive throughout Russian territories and emigré settlements abroad. Reuniting these legendary fighters under imperial banners represents a strategic priority with both practical and symbolic significance. Our comprehensive Cossack restoration program addresses their unique historical status and grievances: traditional territories will receive special administrative status with significant internal autonomy; Cossack military formations will be reestablished with their distinctive ranks, uniforms, and organizational structures; historical land rights will be formally recognized and, where possible, restored; cultural practices including religious observances, educational traditions, and community governance will receive official protection and support; and Cossack atamans will regain their historical role as intermediaries between their communities and imperial authorities. Field Marshal Pyotr Krasnov - himself a Don Cossack and former ataman - provides crucial legitimacy to this outreach effort. Beyond military utility, Cossack restoration serves broader strategic purposes: it creates highly motivated security forces in border regions; establishes reliable population centers resistant to communist infiltration; provides expansion capacity for our military without extensive conscription; and symbolically links our restoration government to historically loyal defenders of the tsarist system.

Our struggle against communist remnants transcends political competition - it is nothing less than a holy war for Russia's spiritual liberation and purification. This understanding must permeate every aspect of our national consciousness and military preparation. Our anti-communist campaign operates simultaneously across multiple domains: religious authorities will formalize theological condemnation of Marxism as fundamentally incompatible with Orthodox Christianity, elevating resistance to communism as a spiritual duty; educational materials will document in unflinching detail the Bolshevik campaign against Russian faith, the mass execution of clergy, the desecration of churches, and the systematic attempt to eradicate Russia's spiritual heritage; cultural productions will contrast the barren materialism of Soviet life with the transcendent richness of traditional Russian spirituality; military training will emphasize that soldiers fight not merely against political opponents but against desecrators of Russia's soul. This framing transforms anti-communist operations from mere power politics to sacred obligation, infusing our struggle with religious fervor that Soviet materialism cannot match. The symbolism is deliberately medieval - our forces are crusaders reclaiming holy ground from infidels, cleansing sacred spaces defiled by godless usurpers. Every battlefield becomes consecrated through the blood of those fighting for Russia's redemption. Every reclaimed church, every restored monastery, every reinstated religious ceremony represents not just cultural preservation but spiritual victory. By framing our campaign in these transcendent terms, we provide motivation far more powerful than nationalist sentiment or political ideology - the certainty that our cause is blessed by divine providence and that our soldiers, should they fall, die as martyrs in a holy struggle for Russia's very soul." # 공산주의를 악마적 이념으로 규정하고 기독교적 가치와 결합한 반공 이데올로기 강화

This unique position imposes upon us a dual mandate: to serve as an impenetrable bulwark defending civilized Russian territories from both foreign domination and internal chaos, while simultaneously preparing for the day when we will transform from defensive barrier to offensive spearhead. Our comprehensive national fortification program addresses both immediate security and long-term ambition. Military construction prioritizes overlapping defensive zones protecting critical infrastructure, transportation hubs, and population centers. Industrial development emphasizes self-sufficiency in essential war materials, ammunition production, and equipment maintenance. Security services establish counter-intelligence networks identifying both German provocateurs and agents of rival Russian factions. Civilian preparedness includes reserve militia training, emergency resource stockpiling, and evacuation protocols. Beyond these practical measures, we cultivate a psychological fortress in our population's consciousness - a sense that Samara represents not just another competing Russian faction but the legitimate nucleus of national resurrection. Our educational system, cultural productions, and public ceremonies reinforce this understanding that we stand as the final guardians of authentic Russian civilization against barbarism from all directions. The Great Barrier we construct is therefore both physical and spiritual - concrete fortifications alongside moral certainty, minefields paired with cultural confidence. When foreign observers look to the fractured Russian landscape, they must recognize that one government alone maintains both the capability and the legitimacy to eventually reunify this shattered nation.
