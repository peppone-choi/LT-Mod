 antarctica_aaa_intro.10.t:0 "The Heart of the Exile"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.10.desc:0 "This wasn't the first time the interlopers had tried to penetrate the Exile's heart. Two tribes had ventured into the eternal twilight, but only one made it out. The universe blinked its eye, and before the Exile knew it, the interlopers were preparing to try again.\n\nThis new tribe christened their journey with tides of blood, sweeping aside those who had also laid claim to the Exile. The leader of this tribe sought to carve a path into the interior with sleds of steel, thinking their inventions made them superior to their predecessors. Time would tell.\n\nThe Exile was amused by the effort these interlopers put into their invasion and the intrepidity of their leader. The Exile even thought he might succeed, and bring great change, if he could survive the ice, the snow, the other tribes, and his own supposedly loyal followers."

 antarctica_aaa_intro.20.t:0 "Synthesis"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.20.desc:0 "The sun blazed out of a cloudless sky on a pristine white desert. Even wearing polarized goggles, Colonel Jorge Edgar Leal had to squint against the glare as he drove his Sno-Cat across the expanse. A scientist, a cartographer, and a soldier sat with him in the cabin. 'Sounds like the start of a bad joke,' Leal mused. Of course, it reflected the state of Antarctica; Argentina needed soldiers to defend the territory, cartographers to map the territory, and scientists to justify having the territory, and that was also the order of priority when it came to the politicking.\n\nMore and more, soldiers had come to characterize Antarctica, and while Leal had been a cavalryman for over two decades, he would much rather be out adventuring instead of harassing the borders of the other territories. If only his fellow officers felt similarly.\n\nCooperation and exploration had been roundly trounced by contention and violence, and Leal feared this trend might be irreversible. To date, the best he could hope for was that scientific and military goals aligned. Fortunately, the upcoming Operación 90 looked like it would provide just such a synthesis. On the surface, it was a military mission to plant the flag of Argentina at the South Pole to prove that this slice of the continent WAS Argentina. But along the way, the mission had developed a scientific component as well, and Leal hoped that the affirmation of national integrity could walk hand in hand with the advancement of mankind's knowledge of this exiled continent."
 antarctica_aaa_intro.20.a:0 "One can only hope."

 antarctica_aaa_intro.30.t:0 "The Right-Hand Man"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.30.desc:0 "Captain Gustavo Adolfo Giró Tapper led his men out on the usual patrol from Esperanza base. The primary focus of the operation was, as always, to ensure that the Chileans were not moving out of their Base "General Bernardo O'Higgins" to violate the Argentine claim to Antarctica.\n\nGod, but all this was disappointing. Giró was of one mind with his superior and friend, Colonel Leal: nothing was better than the plans for Operación 90. Heading south to the Pole would be so much more fulfilling than staring at Chileans from behind binoculars and hoping they wouldn't try anything. Giró had helped build this place, leading many exploratory overland expeditions from San Martín and Esperanza. His talents were wasted guarding borders, he was built for pushing them. The wonder of discovery, of being the first human being to place their feet in the snow drove him ever onward.\n\nYet Giró knew that part of the reality of life, especially in Antarctica, was defending and being prepared to fight for that which belonged to oneself. But even though it was no obstruction to his duty, the nagging wish to pursue Operación 90 still troubled him.\n\nHe only hoped to receive a brief respite to bring it to completion, and that no one would obstruct the Argentine team on its journey to and from the Pole.\n\n"Why are you so fixated on this?" someone might ask. Giró's response would be terse, simple: "To defend Argentina.""
 antarctica_aaa_intro.30.a:0 ""And also for an adventure with Leal - I could think of no one better to travel these frozen lands with.""

 antarctica_aaa_intro.40.t:0 "The Diplomat"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.40.desc:0 "Lieutenant Matteo still didn't know what to make of Juan Carlos Beltramino. Leaned over a topographical map of Antarctica was arguably the man most responsible for the triumph of Argentina in the far south, a genius of international law whose legal and diplomatic machinations had provided the basis for their countries' now vast claims. And yet it was well known across Esperanza base that Beltramino was something of a romantic, a diplomat-conquistador who indulged in poetry and literature as much as planning the liberation of yet another iceberg for the glory of Argentina. Matteo placed the cup of warm Yerba maté on the table and felt a pang of jealousy, the delicious herbal concoction was a rare site on a base dominated by instant coffee rations. As Matteo turned to leave, Beltramino raised his head, a look of giddy excitement crossed his face.\n\n"I would like you to see something, Lieutenant," he said, directing Matteo's gaze to a little dot on the northwest corner of the map labeled Adelaide Island. "I believe our frozen home is about to get a little bit bigger very soon," he continued. Matteo nodded awkwardly, slightly confused.\n\n"Thank you for placing your trust in me, but with all due respect Señor, why are you sharing classified information to a Lieutenant, the Colonel has been clear-"\n\n"Because," Matteo interrupted, his expression gaining an edge of concern. "If... when this claim is pursued it cannot be turned into another Snipe, if you are involved in any capacity and things get heated... try to limit the bloodshed. I don't want any more lives on my conscience and take it from me, a young man like yourself doesn't need that burden."\n\nMatteo nodded noncommittally and excused himself. No matter his respect for Beltramino he could not help but feel resentment at this civilian trying to dictate how he would act on the battlefield much less moralize at him. Leaving the room, he turned to Beltramino replied:"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.40.a:0 ""When the time comes, I will do as my captain orders""

 antarctica_aaa_intro.50.t:0 "A Regular Flight"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.50.desc:0 "The scratched old window refracted golden hues into the tiny cockpit. Vice Commodore Mario Luis Olezza sat forward in his chair, attentive to the controls like they were an integral part of him, and listening to the droning of the wind as it rushed around the aircraft. Stretching out before him was a sea of calm. Dark deep blue stretched into the horizon dotted by drifting ice sheets accumulating at the coast. Slow waves glittered under the clear expansive skies of the Antarctic summer.\n\nAnd breaking through the ice was an armed ship. Olezza could see it hoisted a sky blue and white flag against the darker ocean waters. He saw conflict. Antarctica was Argentina's most distant and underdeveloped province, yet also the one with the most potential in his eyes. He had learned as much after multiple flights across the region and seeing Argentina develop her claim since the 50s.\n\nOlezza liked to think he had a hand to play in that development, helping bring supplies and relief to more isolated bases deep in the continent. A dangerous but rewarding task. Antarctica was as integral to him as any part of his country. It would continue to grow, and he would push for it every step of the way. His relentless support for the development of airways in Antarctica as well as his extreme rescue missions had earned him the nickname 'el Loco.'\n\nBut Olezza also knew none of it would matter if Argentina's claim was swallowed by her rivals. Perhaps that's why Jorge Leal's plans for Operación 90 had been at the forefront of his mind recently. If anyone was as crazy for Antarctica as him, it was Leal. This expedition of his could be another brick in the construction of Argentina's Antarctica. Maybe the most important brick so far."
 antarctica_aaa_intro.50.a:0 "Olezza saw Esperanza Base appear in the horizon, and decided he wanted a part in laying that brick."

 antarctica_aaa_intro.60.t:0 "Musings of a Pioneer"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.60.desc:0 "The clouds of the early morning parted, revealing lighter shades of blue that filled the gray valley of San Martín Base in light. But the light struggled to reach the office of Brigadier General Hernán Pujato, barely chasing away the shadows around the grainy pictures on his desk. The images of warm afternoons in Bolivia sent him back to 1947, when he was placed as a military attache to the embassy. Even back then he had enthusiastically followed the plans for further integration of the Antarctic territories. He recalled when General Perón came on an official visit to Bolivia, and Pujato first showed him his plans and ideas.\n\nHow daring those days were. Pujato tried to feel that same wild excitement in his chest as he thought of the years after. His journey to Greenland, to learn about thriving in the worst conditions in the world. The creation of the Argentine Antarctic Institute and his tenure as its Director. The cheering crowds as they left home to establish San Martín Base, and the struggle to tie communications to the mainland. For a moment he could even see the glimmering frozen coastline from aboard the ARG San Martín, as they sailed to found Belgrano Base in the interior. Pujato's attempts to fly to the Pole had been rebuked by the continent's wrath yet still he dreamt of another way, an overland journey. He had even managed to find a man to lead it, the then Captain Leal.\n\nAfter that only an aching hole remained. Out of all his memories, returning from Antarctica after the fall of Perón was still the most painfully clear and poignant. Only family and some friends received him. No cheering or recognition, he had been too close to Peron, and had very nearly shared his fate. He had turned from pioneer to nobody.\n\nPujato grumbled, gazing at the grainy pictures. He was better than this. Better than a whining old goat, way past his expiration date."
 antarctica_aaa_intro.60.a:0 "No, in his reflection, the pioneer saw much more."

 antarctica_aaa_intro.70.t:0 "The Colonel and the Captain"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.70.desc:0 "Esperanza Base comprised several dozen uniform, garish orange buildings erected scattershot into a rocky escarpment above Hope Bay. Newly-constructed watchtowers straddled rows of barbed wire. Machine gun nests dotted the landscape; Colonel Leal counted ten, up from the five that were there when he'd departed a few weeks ago on a routine patrol.\n\nLeal maneuvered his Sno-Cat, painted the same orange as the buildings and the personnel uniforms, through the checkpoints and parked outside the base headquarters. Captain Gustavo Giró's Sno-Cat was already there. Leal's boot had just hit the ground when Giró stepped onto the porch. "About time," Giró said, saluting and shaking Leal's hand.\n\n"Oh, the weather," Leal said, by way of an explanation, "You know how it is. A little snow."\n\nGiró chuckled, and put his arm around Leal, "Come on inside. Coffee's ready." Inside the headquarters, Leal inquired about Giró's survey of Chile's O'Higgins Base. "They're being smart," Giró said, "No heavy military assets of note, and no armed sorties. Nothing that could be construed as aggressive."\n\nLeal heaved a great sigh, "Thank God for that. The last thing we need is more bloodshed. And the rest of our command staff, are they almost here?"\n\n"Beltramino is in his office, Olezza will be landing in the hour, and Pujato will arrive by nightfall."\n\n"I'm glad the General will grace us with his presence. It's been getting harder and harder to dig Pujato out of San Martín.""
 antarctica_aaa_intro.70.a:0 ""No harder than digging our way to the South Pole.""

 antarctica_aaa_intro.80.t:0 "Operación 90"
 antarctica_aaa_intro.80.desc:0 "Leal. Giró. Olezza. Beltramino. Pujato. All these men had left their mark on Antarctica, and now they were gathered under one roof in the place they'd claimed for Argentina. Soon, they would undertake a mission that would cement Argentine Antarctica as an inseparable part of Argentina for all time.\n\n"Operación 90," said Leal, "is simple in conception: a mechanized journey overland from Belgrano I to the South Pole, thereby to plant a flag, and return alive," He leaned forward, "Simple, but it will only succeed if we meticulously manage our supplies and allocate enough to the Operación to ensure it survives. Olezza will lead aerial reconnaissance missions to establish locations for our supply dumps in the interior. Captain Giró and I will lead the main expeditionary force to the pole. Questions?"\n\nPujato shook his head, "I'm concerned with the increasing scale of the expedition, Jorge. During our preparations, maintaining a low profile will be a challenge, all of the extra supplies and material flowing in will be noticed," Pujato paused to drink his coffee and continued, "We cannot afford a confrontation in the interior, our margin of error is thin as it is.\n\n"We're doing our best to make it look like business as usual, I suspect the Japanese for the most part will ignore our efforts, however the Germans claim the Pole via Amundsen, the OFN by Scott, and who knows what the Chileans might do if they find out," said Leal.\n\nBeltramino chimed in, "I'm all for the Operación. It is not only legal, but can be accomplished without the use of force. Moving forth as explorers instead of warriors would look good internationally, and help rehabilitate our image after the Snipe Incident."\n\nLeal nodded, "Operación 90 must proceed in absolute secrecy, but if our competitors challenge us, we may be forced to become warriors again.""

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.10.t: "An Impassioned Request"
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.10.desc: ""c/o the Argentine Antarctic Institute."\n\n"I am writing to you to confirm that Operación 90 is to be launched during the summer of next year. The goal of planting the flag of Argentina at the utmost extremity of our nation's territory is of the highest importance to me, my men, the Institute, and our country. All efforts should be focused on the completion of the operation."\n\n"However, in recent months, I have noticed a disconcerting trend regarding the allocation of supplies. More and more, our supply shipments are being filled with weapons, ammunition, and fortification materials, instead of the things we really need to preserve our existence in Antarctica: dog sleds, Sno-Cats, and easily transportable and storable foodstuffs like pemmican."\n\nLeal leaned back in his chair and cracked his knuckles. He picked up his pen and continued writing, "While we have a clear and present need to defend ourselves, this kind of military buildup is exactly what led to the Snipe Incident four years ago. I need not remind you of the cost of that event."\n\nLeal penned his signature and sighed. He couldn't believe it, but it looked like history might repeat itself, and on a much shorter timescale than usual. He was, however, adamant that should Operación 90 succeed, Argentina might find a new way forward, one of hope and confidence instead of blind belligerence."
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.10.a: "Leal prayed he was not alone in that belief."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.20.t: "Special Delivery"
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.20.desc: "Colonel Leal and Captain Giró stood on the porch of the Esperanza HQ, sipping coffee as they watched the Sno-Cats file through the defensive checkpoints. "The Institute responded quickly," said Giró, impressed, "What favors did you have to promise to accomplish that?"\n\n"So pragmatic," Leal chuckled, "I simply appealed to their sense of patriotism. The benefits of the Operación are self-evident."\n\nGiró huffed, "Try telling that to the Navy."\n\nLeal might've been smiling, but behind that smile, he was disappointed. While the supplies may have been delivered promptly, being flown in from Ushuaia, they were only half of what he'd hoped for. Still, beggars couldn't be choosers. It would have to do for now.\n\nLeal and Giró gulped the last of their coffee and went to help unpack the clowder of orange cats that had assembled in the yard. "Oh, after we're done here," said Giró, "I'll show you the first list of expedition candidates.""

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.30.desc: "Leal and Giró were snowed in, both literally and figuratively. Outside, a blizzard had swept through Esperanza Base, forcing everyone to take shelter until it passed. Inside the headquarters, Leal and Giró had taken the opportunity to review the applicants for Operación 90. There were a great many of them, over a hundred from across Argentine Antarctica, and most of them were highly qualified.\n\nLeal set down the dossier he was reading and rubbed his eyes, "Maybe we should come at this from a different direction," He looked at Giró, "The most important element of the expedition is our method of locomotion. This is the first overland polar expedition since Scott's, and like him, we're partly mechanized. We can't repeat his mistakes. Our priority should be ensuring that our machines don't fail us when we need them most."\n\nGiró already saw where Leal was going with this, and had started fishing through the pile for mechanics, "So we need an expert in winterized automotives," He found the file he was looking for and met Leal's gaze, "Are we thinking of the same man?" He handed the file to Leal."

Giró had gone out to the motor pool and sent CWO Ricardo Ceppi back to HQ for an interview with Leal. Leal had barely gotten the question past his lips when Ceppi said, "I'm in. When do we leave?"\n\nBoth men laughed, knowing it would be more than a year before the expedition was ready. "The first step," said Leal, "will be to select your team of mechanics. Once they're in place, we'll make our choice of vehicle and build the expedition out from there."\n\n"I already have some people in mind," said Ceppi. "As for the vehicle, my suggestion would be to use our Tucker Sno-Cats. They've served us well so far, they're robust, and relatively easy to repair in the field. There are some alternatives, of course. I know the Swedes have a vehicle that's quite popular in Europe, and there are other American companies like KRISTI and Thiokol with products on the market. There might be certain political or economic incentives to choosing one of their vehicles, but from a pure efficiency standpoint, I don't think anything can beat the Sno-Cat."\n\nLeal nodded slowly. "I'll think on the matter. In the meantime..." He stood up and offered Ceppi his hand."

The final decision has yet to be made, and Leal wants to consider all the options. Bulacio, Rodriguez, what does old man Pujato have you using in San Martín?"\n\nBulacio shrugged. "Mostly the same as you: Sno-Cats. Although, he did recently source some Swedish Aktiv Fischer Snow Tracs."\n\n"They drive pretty well," Rodriguez added. "In fact they have a steering wheel like a car, instead of levers. Much easier to train men to drive them. Mind you, driving to the pole is a different level of duress."\n\n"That's true of every vehicle," said Ceppi. "Nothing we've got has made that journey before.

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.60.t: "The Snowcats"
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.60.desc: "Even with some soundproofing on Ceppi's office walls, the buzz of machine tools still penetrated up through the floor from the Esperanza motor pool. A fug of petrol and burnt metal filled the air. Today, Colonel Leal would make a decision with Ceppi about which snowcat they'd take to the pole.\n\n"In summary," said Ceppi, laying three files in front of Leal, "here are the differences." He placed his hand on the leftmost file. "The Swedish Aktiv Fischer Snow Trac. The most user-friendly of the vehicles. It drives similarly to an automobile, has a Volkswagen flat 4 engine, it's easy to repair, and it doesn't use its brakes for turning, so they don't wear out as quickly. Brigadier General Pujato has spoken favorably of them"\n\n"Beltramino has been putting feelers out to the Swedes for weeks," said Leal. "They're very eager to work with us. So eager in fact, they're willing to help us make inroads with Bofors to secure new weaponry."\n\nCeppi moved to the centre file. "Thiokol's Trackmaster 4T-10 is brand new, only on the market since last year. Never tested in Antarctica, only in Alaska and Canada, but it has more than double the capacity for personnel and supplies compared to our other options. Thiokol will give us an exclusive discount if we switch to them."\n\nCeppi moved to the right file. "And of course, our Tucker Sno-Cat. Everyone here uses it, and everyone here knows it well. If we use the vehicles we already have, we can allocate more of our budget for the Operación itself."\n\n"All three have their merits," said Leal as he made his decision."
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.60.a: ""We already know the Tucker Sno-Cat very well, Let's not introduce an unknown variable so close to the Operación.""
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.60.b: ""I'll tell Beltramino to confirm with the Swedes, I like the Snow Trac's usability and low maintenance.""

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.70.t: "Ol' Reliable"
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.70.desc: "The snow crunched underneath the Tucker Sno-Cat's treads. CWO Ceppi was observing a training exercise wherein new Sno-Cat operators attempted to take a vehicle over one of the frozen embankments behind Esperanza. The Sno-Cats themselves handled nearly any challenge one could throw at them; fine operation was all down to the driver. You could tell a new operator by how they handled turns. The process of braking and switching between sets of treads took some getting used to. It was altogether not dissimilar to the operation of a tank.\n\nEven so, the driver Ceppi was watching was doing a pretty good job. After the initial learning curve, most people enjoyed how reliable the motor controls of the Sno-Cat were. Ceppi was happy that Leal had gone with the vehicle they knew best. As the old adage went, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."\n\nAnd even if something did need fixing, they'd have plenty of parts to spare. The budget that had been allocated for the acquisition of snowcats had instead gone to sourcing a cornucopia of replacement parts. By making do with what they had, they had ensured full redundancy in terms of repairing their method of transport."

CWO Ceppi stepped out of the workshop, followed by First Sergeants Bulacio and Rodriguez. "Enjoying yourself I see," Ceppi laughed.\n\n"I think we made a very good choice," said Beltramino, puffing smoke. "It's a maneuverable vehicle. It shouldn't take anyone more than an afternoon to learn how to drive, least of all you fellows."\n\nAs they spoke, one Snow Trac after another filed in, some towing trailers.\n\nCeppi rose an eyebrow. "I wasn't told about any other cargo."\n\nBeltramino flashed a smile. "The Swedes came through on their promises about putting us in touch with Bofors. We now have a direct supply contract with them for anti-aircraft weaponry, and potentially even more."\n\n"Leave it to the Swedes to give you a snowcat in one hand and an anti-aircraft battery in the other.

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.100.desc: ""Esperanza Base, stand by, grabbing the reports..."\n\nIt was the third time today Esperanza Base asked for information about naval activity in the zone Luis was assigned to. Camara Base was a small naval base located in Menguante Cove on Half Moon Island. Normally things were quiet, aside from the odd ship that had to wait out a storm or receive minor repairs. Recently however there were a lot of ships coming into Camara, plenty of which Luis had never seen before. Civilian ships, mainly, but also some new warships. Seeing the base become a lively place was strange, but it was not Luis' concern. As radio operator for Camara, he was mainly seated behind a table, communicating with the rest of the territory, and answering requests, which had doubled recently. Maybe the sudden rise in traffic was correlated to this rise in report demands emitted by Esperanza?\n\nHe grabbed the reports that Felipe, the officer in charge of captaincy, had given him earlier, and started reading them aloud, transmitting coordinates and port rotation schedules to his counterpart: "Esperanza Base, this is Camara Base, transmitting the first report now... the Río Quinto has left its refueling station and is heading back to Ushuaia... Second report... ARA Rosario is undergoing repairs at the moment: the hull was cracked from an encounter with an iceberg. Third and final report... Mellino I has left the port and is headed toward coordinates 70°19'S and 36°12'W as planned, hoping to catch a whale! Anyways, Esperanza Base, that's all. Camara Base, out."\n\nAs he switched off the radio receiver Luis turned to his window, the reports in one hand. Something told him what he just read was not precisely correct: sure enough, the Río Quinto was leaving, and the Mellino I too, but they did not seem to head towards any of the directions he had announced. And similarly, the ARA Rosario did not look to be undergoing repairs at all... What were his superiors doing by having him read such reports?"

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.110.desc: "Aside from snow and wind, the quintessential feature of Antarctic life was dogs. Huskies had made polar exploration possible, at both ends of the world. Man lived and died by the usage of these animals, and it was a fool who ignored the events which had reinforced that lesson. Amundsen had reached the pole with dogs; Scott had died for want of them. Leal was nothing if not a student of Antarctic history.\n\nOn the outskirts of Esperanza Base stood the kennels that housed the dozens of sled teams that made Argentine Antarctica possible. When the winds grounded aircraft, the pack ice blocked all shipping, and the Sno-Cats finally broke down, it was the dogs that kept this base, and all others, alive.\n\nLeal sat alone on a boulder overlooking the training grounds and obstacle courses that ensured man and hound worked as one. He knew he would need to train more teams for Operación 90, but he'd just received a request that might preclude that training. Several outlying bases, mostly run by the Navy, had asked for a top-up of supplies ahead of the encroaching winter.\n\nLeal also knew that nearly half the shipments would be military equipment. The Navy claimed it was necessary to maintain the integrity and security of the claim. Leal had serious doubts, but one did not off-handedly reject the requests of the Navy. So, he could either acquiesce to their requests, and possibly give them more means to disrupt the peace, or he could keep the dogs and risk the ire of one of the strongest institutions in Argentina."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.120.desc: "Petty Officer Garcia had a love of canned peaches. The succulent taste of fruit after weeks of bully beef and hardtack was refreshing. Sled teams dispatched from Esperanza Base had been arriving over the past couple of days at Primavera Base, carrying medical supplies and food stuffs. However the bulk of the deliveries had been military material.\n\nIt was a trend Garcia had noticed over the last few months: his naval outpost had been requesting weapons and ammunition far in excess of that which was required to defend the claim.\n\nHe didn't know where they went, either, because they weren't being stored on-base. Garcia's bet was that it was something to do with a regular arrival of military vessels. Stranger still was the occasional civilian ship; crates were loaded onto them, and they'd disappear into the seas surrounding Antarctica.\n\nHe was no fool. He knew something was afoot. But he didn't care. As long as the rations kept arriving and his men stayed healthy, it was someone else's problem."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.130.desc: "There were few sights as heartwarming as men and dogs working together.\n\nColonel Leal reclined in a folding chair on the field behind the Esperanza kennels, watching his new sled teams attempt to navigate obstacle courses. These huskies were recent arrivals in Antarctica. Barely a year old, they'd traveled by boat from Argentina. The youngest of the dogs, Juneau chased a man on a ski-doo, who paused occasionally to reward her with raw beef.\n\nThe training was as much for the men as it was for the canines. Groups of huskies were a noisy bunch, often at each other's throats as pack power dynamics played out. The men had to learn to grow accustomed to the huskies' behavior, and to know how to assert control.\n\nSome of the sergeants were being taught how to ski alongside the dogs; the packs were easily distracted, and required men to keep pace beside them, keeping them on task.\n\nLeal knew the Navy wouldn't take this slight lying down. They'd expected military supplies to be delivered promptly via sled team, and Leal hadn't cooperated. He'd deal with the ramifications of that after the winter. For now, his teams needed to train. Operación 90 would succeed or fail based on how well-trained the sled teams were."

Once the sea ice reached its maximum, nobody would be getting in or out until the sun returned.\n\nBefore the Scramble, overwintering was rare in Antarctica, with the human population of the continent falling into the low hundreds, if not dozens, depending on whether an active expedition was taking place.\n\nNow, many thousands of souls endured temperatures plunging to -20 Celsius on the coast, to -40 and lower inland. Fierce blizzards carried by katabatic winds from the polar plateau could bury outposts and made movement difficult, especially for aircraft.\n\nAll bases in Antarctica shed personnel as winter's grip tightened on the continent. Fears of armed conflict subsided as everyone turned their energies toward battling the elements. Severe depression and vitamin deficiency also necessitated a regular rotation of personnel from Antarctica.\n\nAs Beltramino watched Esperanza recede behind him, he was struck by just how hostile this place was. It was as if the continent itself was determined to evict mankind from its frozen shores. A single lapse in logistics, or a freak accident, could mean the annihilation of an entire base.\n\nBeltramino was glad Leal, Giró, Olezza, and Pujato were staying behind. Their experience uplifted the men and gave them hope during the darkness of winter."

Argentina had certainly not neglected the liquor reserves; one of the last supply ships in for the season had brought with it crate upon crate of Fernet Branca, a cultural icon of Argentina resulting from generations of Italian migration. The sweet liqueur was made sweeter when mixed with Coca-Cola. On this particular winter's eve, Colonel Leal and Captain Giró had done plenty of mixing.\n\n"Here's to another winter in Antarctica," said Leal, clinking his glass against Giró's, "How are your preparations going for the expedition to San Martín?"\n\n"I have three snowcats and a dog sled team chomping at the bit to head out. CWO Ceppi and his mechanics will accompany me as well as several other promising candidates for Operación 90."\n\n"Excellent, should prove a fruitful learning experience, an overland crossing in the dead of winter is sure to test both the vehicles and the men. When summer arrives, we're going to have our work cut out for us. We still have about half the team to fill out for Operación 90, and I'll need you and Olezza to start launching exploratory patrols and aerial reconnaissance missions from Belgrano I after you reach Pujato at San Martín. We need to determine where our forward supply dump will be for our journey to the pole."\n\n"Lots to do and little time to do it," said Giró, "Let's enjoy our time off while we can.""

Were it not for his position downwind from the yelling of CWO Ceppi's men loading the snowcats, Captain Giró probably wouldn't have been able to make out his home for the next four months.\n\nGiró was to undertake an overland sojourn in the dead of winter to reach San Martín Base 1800 kilometers away. Three snowcats and a dog sled would carry Giró, Ceppi and his mechanics, and several other promising Operación 90 candidates across the Larsen Ice Shelf, and the Antarctandes mountains, to reach Pujato's base on the other side.\n\n"Glad to see morale is high," Colonel Leal yelled through the deafening winds.\n\n"It's a shame you can't come with us," Giró yelled.\n\n"I wish I could, but someone has to keep an eye on the navy."\n\nGiró shook his head, "I don't understand how anyone wouldn't want to do this. We're pioneers! Discovering places that no human has ever seen before. How could they not want to be a part of this?"\n\n"I hate to break it to you," Leal chuckled, "but I think most people think we are insane for exploring this place."\n\n"We're ready to go," Ceppi shouted through the wind.\n\nLeal spoke up, "Looks like it's time for you to leave behind Esperanza. Farewell and good luck."\n\n"And good luck riding your desk," Giró chuckled.\n\nWith a thick gloved handshake and a wave, Giró climbed aboard his snowcat,"

He walked over and poured himself a small cup taking a satisfied sip. Despite the howling winds and the dark outside, he felt a sense of warmth wash over him, a small sense of satisfaction as he looked out at the other huts which lined the base's so-called "Main Street". This post was not as glamorous as the one he used to occupy back in the capital, but he took satisfaction in his quiet corner of heaven where he and his men carved out their place in what one could reasonably call the final frontier. "Well, that is until we get a space program like the Germans. It might not be under Peron but it'll be for Argentina..." His thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a young private.\n\n"At ease son, would you like a cup?" pointing to the pot on the stove.\n\n"It's been a while since I've had fresh coffee sir," He said in a gracious tone, Pujato smiled at the comment, it wasn't much but small gestures meant a lot to the men. "So, I presume you've got my mail?" The private reached into the bag and pulled out three things for him. A magazine for veterans, A personal care package from his family, and most interestingly, a telegram straight from the capital. Being the commander of an Antarctic base had its privileges not least of which was prioritized mail shipments, even during winter. The letter from the Argentine Antarctic Institute mentioned that his base was going to be the first to receive a fresh shipment of supplies when winter broke, enabling him to spend his current supplies more freely. He looked between the young mailman and his collection of letters, deciding on how best to prepare his men for whatever this continent had in store for them.\n\n"Young man, I need you to deliver a message for me."

Even the most shallow of breaths formed clouds of fog, and caused pain in the lungs.\n\nMost people would detest these conditions. But Brigadier General Pujato was not like most people.\n\nThe Conqueror of the White Desert paced behind his men, monitoring their drills and exercises. Bayonet thrusts were parried with great acumen just as sharpshooters nailed targets through driving snow.\n\nEven in these conditions, they were performing admirably, handling their rifles and kit in a manner befitting their extensive training.

He and his squadmates were cautiously relaxing, hoping that whatever fluke that canceled their grueling itinerary would not be reversed.\n\nHowever, at 1700, Pascal and his Boat Crew were ordered to the Galley of San Martín Base. What awaited them was a pleasant surprise. Sailors, soldiers, and airmen were treated to a lavish feast with plenty to go around.\n\nAs the men received their meals and sat at their seats, the various Antarctic veterans who had tales to tell spaced themselves out, making sure all the enlisted and junior officers were able to get their time with the legends.\n\nPascal was in a daze, enjoying the moment of respite from his usually exhaustive routine. In fact, he was so distracted that he failed to notice that all eyes had turned to him. "Sailor, are you okay?" General Pujato chuckled.\n\n"Oh, yes sir, just exhausted," Second Sailor Pascal stated. His shipmates were blindsided by the blatant honesty.\n\nThe Brigadier General nodded, "I see... can you elaborate? I don't often get the chance to talk to the lower enlisted."\n\n"Of course sir, I don't mind the intensity of our drills, but we barely get any time to catch our breath. In fact, just today we thought our lack of work was a clerical error rather than intentional."\n\nGeneral Pujato smirked, "Thank you for your honesty.

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.200.desc: "Giró could not see his hand, but he could feel the entire world moving under his boots. The crew was huddled together, clinging at the side of the last of the snowcats. Its headlights blinked ahead, barely making a dent in the pitch black surroundings. Whirling gusts of wind slammed over and over against them. Like walls of snow and ice smashing into them from the dark. Pushing against the shocking currents, Giró and the men held on. They put as much force as they could while the snowcat turned to the right.\n\nA large rift lay ahead of them. It was the third they had passed in their crossing of the Larsen Ice Shelf. The two other snowcats had gone around first, alongside the dogs and the rest of the crew. But staying together was paramount to the mission. They had to reunite, or the storm would swallow them one by one. He repeated that thought, wiping away the frost accumulating on his goggles.\n\nRelentlessly the blizzard's roar enveloped and drowned even his own thoughts. The darkness encroached to snuff away the memory of anything other than frigid, unimaginable cold. Before him yawned the rift, the snowcats lights shining on its slippery frozen edge. Carefully they trudged around the chasm. The void it opened into seemed deeper and darker than anything Giró had ever seen.\n\nAnd beneath them the ice moved still. The shelf cracking and grinding, like someone like the gnashing of teeth. Tired legs were shaken by the booms and shocks coming through the ground. The terrible heartbeat of the continent itself quaking as the freezing ocean rushed only a few centimeters under.\n\nHe'd have one hell of a story to tell next time he met with Leal. That's what he'd do, right? He'd finish this expedition like the others before. Then maybe get a drink. God, he could use a drink right now."

He could do more here, anyway. A penchant for diplomatic maneuvering and charm would be far more useful against human beings than, say, Gentoo penguins.\n\nBeltramino was going to focus his efforts on governmental lobbying, to convince the Ministry of Economy and other prominent players to divert more funding to the Argentine Antarctic Institute instead of the Navy. The fierce competition between the AAI and the Navy for resources made such matters necessary and routine.\n\nThat plan had been certain, but something had changed. Some time back Beltramino had heard that a German attaché from the DGfP with responsibility for Antarctic matters was present in the embassy. Conversing with that man, distasteful though he and most of his Hitlerite kin were, might legitimize a few more of the Argentine claims to Antarctica.\n\nWhat a conundrum. Lobbying the government, or talking with that German? There were advantages to either side. Beltramino chose to..."

The sights and smells had a charm all their own, as beautiful as Antarctica was in its cold, contemplative silence. Cars and buses honking away, cyclists and deliverymen negotiating past them, shopkeepers hawking their wares, meat cooking on parrillas, the chatter of people talking about Peñarol or the latest Casa Rosada flap du jour: this was what the AAI worked to defend and protect.\n\nAll the better, then, that his efforts to lobby the government had worked. The decision: allocate slightly more resources to the AAI than the Antarctic detachment of the Navy. This was for the best, those Navy men, they had never met a crisis or an opportunity they did not want to brutally overreact to.\n\nPerhaps, now that the AAI had some more resources, peace and legality would finally start to become the norm in Antarctica.

The usual pleasantries, "I hope Buenos Aires has been a pleasant experience", and so on and so forth, were exchanged, drinks and food were set out by the proprietor (an old friend of Beltramino's), and then they got down to brass tacks.\n\nDuring Peron's administration, Argentina's claims to the Antarctic had been supported by Germany. However following the full-scale Scramble for Antarctica and the Snipe Incident in 1958, relations had cooled.\n\nNow, the German attaché proposed a reversal of that trend: that Germany would recognize the Argentine claim to Chilean held Adelaide Island in exchange for intelligence sharing on OFN operations in the Argentine sea surrounding the Malvinas and the Drake Passage.\n\nTo Beltramino, this was not only a fair deal, but international recognition of the clear legal claim Argentina had to Antarctica.

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.240.desc: "The frantic messages for help had fallen silent almost half an hour ago. On the communications radio there was only blurred static, as the operator periodically called for any response. It all went unanswered. Mario Luis Olezza watched the clock tick by, as the blizzard outside pushed against the cabin's thin walls. "Nothing," the operator said, and laid back in his chair, "We've lost all communication."\n\nA powerful storm had swept the winter night, isolating Esperanza Base from its many outposts in the interior. It was in those terrible conditions that they had received the distress call. Some sort of accident had occurred, and evacuation was necessary. Olezza had seen it time and time again. That's why he'd been called.\n\nThe static buzzed on, matching with the roar of swarming snow. A solemn harmony. Every second that he wasted was another layer of snow burying the embattled outpost. But going out in these conditions? Would it do more harm than good?\n\nOlezza marched out of the building facing freezing gusts that turned his blood to ice in his veins. Surely, he had gone through worse. Esperanza Base's runway was marked by harsh orange lights, flaming against the pitch black sky. Katabatic winds picked up clouds of snow around him, but the runway was still clear enough for him to take off. He had seen worse. With determination as his warmth, Olezza approached the Douglas C-47s lining the side of the runway. Their large metal hulls creaked and groaned at the snowstorm's blasts.\n\nA mechanic, wobbling in a huge orange jacket, appeared from under the shadow of one aircraft. He saw Olezza approaching, and shouted, "Are you insane? Fly right now and you'll crash yourself in the bay!""

Olezza did not flinch at the turbulence in his seat. Groaning bellowed all around him, as the roaring storm shook the aircraft. Through it all, he did not take his eyes from the red triangle. The lights flickered like firecrackers, but remained a red beacon in the night. If there were distress signals, that meant at least one person was still alive.\n\nThe C-47 resembled a can of tuna fish as it descended. Quaking metal creaked inside the cockpit. Furious gusts of wind raced over jagged ice caps and hills, blasting snow just below Olezza. He attempted to flow along the storm, the red lights illuminating a strip of flat ground. A small window to land. He made an almost graceful descent, steady as he narrowly crossed over the Exile's howls.\n\nHe could see nothing when he stepped outside. Nothing except the lights, which blinked ever weaker. He trudged across the field, the wind dragging him away from them and into the darkness. Olezza clung as strong as he could, sometimes reduced to crawling below the flying ice. He heard nothing but the storm, screaming all around him, and felt nothing but the cold biting through his jacket. Yet he continued, and eventually hazy shadows formed, cast in the glow of the smoking red lights. The survivors struggled to move as much as he did, but they waved at him. It gave Olezza renewed energy to reach them.\n\nAfter what seemed an eternity, Olezza and the beleaguered crew came together, crawling back to his plane. One man was unconscious, half-frozen and injured. He was saved by Olezza's medical supplies. The others carried what little they could salvage from the base in way of supplies back to the plane. They would not be flying any time soon. Their aircraft was frosting, lacking in fuel, and scarred by a forceful landing. It would take some time to repair, expending what little could be salvaged from the outpost. So be it, lives matter most after all."

Heated liquid sprayed over the body and wings of the aircraft, while Olezza watched from the pilot seat. He boarded as soon as he could, having sat restless for hours. Not a single message had been heard from the lost outpost. Ice and frost washed away from the windscreens, the de-icing solution dripping down in waves. They had waited so long, Olezza thought, as his trembling fingers brushed the controls.\n\nBarren stretches of white rolled below him, surrounding hills and ridges made barely visible by the clear starry sky. The moon hung low and far along the coast, as he saw it, Olezza was struck by how quiet the winter night seemed. Not a single cloud or sign of life crossed him as he flew. The winds, so furious a few hours earlier, had fallen into soft howls breezing past the aircraft. Perhaps this easier weather had given a break to the embattled crew.\n\nWhen he arrived at the outpost, there was no wind at all. Olezza ventured off the plane, towards where the outpost ought to be. Although remaining steel-strong, he hoped he could at least hear a voice from any of the men he'd come to rescue. A cheer would suffice as much as a cry for help. All was frozen still as he walked through what remained of the base, surrounded by the cutting shadows of buildings buried in snow and ice. So many layers of snow and ice.\n\nOlezza shouted and called for any sign of life. He found them eventually. A group of frozen bodies, huddled together for lost warmth. The faces that had made them recognizable, living, breathing humans, were lost in white frost. He stared at them for a moment, and grit his teeth. He should have gone earlier. He could have saved them. He could have done something. Why had he been such a coward?"

A pre-WWI gunboat, the Rosario was the first in a class designed for riverine patrol operations, but during the Scramble for Antarctica, many mothballed ships had been pressed back into service as Argentina attempted to secure the littoral of its Antarctic claim. The Rosario had been partially refitted to ensure it could survive the harsh Antarctic seas, but the fact remained that it was a coastal-bound ship unfit for the open ocean.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Chilean navy, though inferior in number, possessed a technological advantage in missile cruisers, a result of their resounding defeat during the Snipe Incident.\n\nThis advantage kept Argentine sailors up at night, and was especially true for the crew of ARA Rosario, who now found themselves interdicting a Chilean ship attempting to reach Adelaide Island. The Chilean appeared to only be a transport, most likely carrying civilian scientists to the island, but it could also be carrying military materiel and men. Hell, it could even be bait working with a nearby missile cruiser, just waiting for an Argentine vessel to enter its range. There would be no help for anyone who sank in these waters.\n\nRosario's captain announced his intention to turn the Chilean back using a warning salvo across its bow. Pascal hoped they would have the sense to turn back rather than risk an incident, although it seemed to be his own people doing most of the escalating these days. The whole crew waited with bated breath as the archaic howitzer turrets took aim. Belching smoke, the guns sent two shells careening just past the bridge of the opposing ship. Pascal thought the Chileans had been getting bolder in recent months. One of these days they might even fire back."

In a chain they stumbled, the powerful winds unceasing, pushing them back onto their frozen heels.\n\nGiró led the chain, following the snowcat's light as it shone through grayish clouds of snow. Around him the wind screamed. The blizzard's orchestra howled higher as the winds blew past the sharp cliffs and crevices, and bellowed strongly as it flowed downhill.\n\nHolding onto the man behind him, Giró took each step on the dry rocks with care. Each step was a challenge of its own. Sharp, slippery, rocks. Tiny and encrusted in ice, or rendered smooth from uncountable storms. They lined the path through the mountains. Over and over the men would fall. Little more than ragdolls in the way of the merciless gusts. The chain, however, did not separate, staying close to the snowcats cruising along the edges of the mountain.\n\nOnly the dogs, encrusted in frost but always warm, lunged forward in daring spite against the elements. One of them bore his teeth into one of the human adventurers as the chain broke. The man had slipped over a sharp edge. He would have slipped into the grasps of the black storm too were it not for the canine companion.\n\nGiró allowed his thoughts to flow free from survival instinct while the men reorganized.

Whereas others would opt to stay shut indoors, waiting out the long night, Leal liked to keep his men active, to keep their bodies in shape, and their minds off of home.\n\nIn fact, he encouraged them to think of Antarctica as their home, as much as any other part of Argentina. After all, that was the truth, was it not?\n\nLeal was currently supervising a challenge that would serve as an application process for Operación 90. While there were many capable navigators within Argentine Antarctica, only the cream of the crop could successfully chart a path to the pole while simultaneously drawing new, more accurate maps that would solidify the borders of the claim. It was one of the many ways in which the Operación was safeguarding the future.\n\nThe challenge Leal had set his surveyors was to map ten square kilometers in all directions from Esperanza, during a blizzard, in the Antarctic night.\n\nThe men worked in pairs, with radios, each taking a snowcat and limited fuel. Retrieval teams on ski-doos stood by in case anyone needed help.\n\nLeal cross-referenced their results with existing maps. Some of the teams produced maps that were better than the ones on file. But only one team returned with completely accurate maps, plus fuel and time to spare. Leal chose them to help guide the expedition to the pole."

Afterwards, a dessert of dulce de leche made from condensed milk served alongside piping hot chocolate, and as much coffee as the men could guzzle.\n\nLeal stood off to the side of the room, the toasts having been made, and the meal well underway. This was what he loved most: brotherhood on the last frontier of Earth. The feast wasn't solely a goodwill gesture. Morale sank even under optimal conditions during the brutal, dark Antarctic winter. It was imperative to keep the men's spirits up, lest melancholia get a foothold in their minds.\n\nLeal crossed the raucous galley to sit with his newly-selected surveyors, First Sergeants Carrion and Moreno. "Congratulations on an excellent piece of navigation," said Leal. "If you can find your way in this darkness, the pole will be no trouble at all."\n\nBoth men laughed at the overstatement. Anybody could find the pole. Getting there and back again in one piece, literally, was the hard part.

Then he spoke into the receiver once again, "Command, can you repeat the summarized news bulletin from Tierra Del Fuego?"\n\nThe drab voice on the other end grunted in response, "The Triumvirate has officially dissolved following a terrorist bombing at the Malta Conference. Before the attack, we had offered to lease Galindez Island to the Italians to obtain certain economic concessions and military equipment. In the aftermath of the attack our delegation at Malta decided to follow through with the deal to prove our commitment to our Italian allies, Triumvirate or no. Italian Admiral Torrisi is already on his way now. Can I go now, Colonel?"\n\n"Sure, sure, thank you for the update," said Leal switching off the receiver.\n\n"Lieutenant, how fast can you prepare Galindez Island for transfer. Give me a pessimistic estimate."\n\nZavala pondered upon the perfect answer to give to the Colonel. The higher he climbed up the officer corps, the harder it was to advance. An opportunity like this was something that could push him up another rung of the ladder. "Two weeks, but only if you fly me out tonight," Zavala confidently answered.\n\n"Very well, I'll make the arrangements, and just so you know, Pujato is going to take all the credit, I need to throw him a bone to keep him happy, but I'll know who actually did all the heavy lifting," Leal stated.\n\nAs Zavala vacated the room, Leal stopped him once more, to impart a final piece of advice to the junior officer."

They were shivering out there," Zavala observed.\n\n"You wanna know why? They aren't using loose winter clothing, they've got thick wool greatcoats that suck up moisture and make sweat freeze to your body. That's how Sub-Lieutenant Jimenez got hypothermia last month. Either way, it's not our problem anymore."\n\nZavala nodded, "We'll probably get a medal, if we're lucky... maybe even a promotion. But the Italians?

With the winter ebbing, Leal wanted to inspect the base and its facilities as they prepared for the next stage of planning for Operación 90. In particular, he had wanted to catch up on the activities of the signals building, and find a suitable radio operator for the expedition. The signal building at Esperanza was, in many ways, the central nervous system of Argentine Antarctica. It sent communications between different outposts and bases, ensured supplies got to where they needed to be on time, and of course, coordinated their military activity. It was how the right hand and the left hand knew what the other was doing. It was like a beehive there, abuzz with the activity of workers. Leal never failed to be impressed with the efficiency of the operators, fingers dancing across typewriter keys, or tapping out perfect Morse code at breakneck speeds. The radio receivers crackling as perfectly enunciated orders kept Argentina in this frozen land.\n\nLeal considered how radio had enabled a new era of Antarctic exploration and development. When Admiral Richard E. Byrd made his First Antarctic Expedition, his team used radio to maintain contact with the outside world and to coordinate their activity. Now, radio was a function of existence in Antarctica, and would be a necessity for their assault on the South Pole. While there were many qualified radio operators at Esperanza there was one man in particular he wanted to meet. Leal walked over to his station and said "First Sergeant Domingo Zacarias?" Zacarias continued monitoring the radio and didn't respond. Leal responded, a bit more firmly, but without frustration, "Zacarias!"\n\nHe replied, "Oh, can it wait a moment, I'm-" he then looked over and realized who he was speaking to. He stood up and saluted him, "Yes sir. Apologies, Colonel!"\n\nLeal smiled and said "At ease. I know that you're the best operator we've got.

She was an old gunboat, but the crew would never ask for another ship to patrol the islands of Antarctica. However creaky and rusty the vessel may be, it had served them well until now. Planting flags was a tedious process, but it was also a guaranteed way to avoid involvement in the political mess that was brewing back home.\n\nWhen the next isle tore through the mist, a party of five men was sent ashore to plant the flag. Wiencke Island officially belonged to Chile, but so did the previous islands they had planted flags on, and they had been uninhabited. The shore party had landed and began to search for a good vantage point for the flag when one of the men signaled to the officer the wooden hut he had spotted and the Chilean flag flying beside it. It was in rough shape, and looked abandoned, but no one was taking any chances. The Argentine sailors drew their rifles and proceeded to encircle the hut.\n\nSecond Sailor Lugo Pascal cautiously approached the door, then burst into the hut. Inside were two soldiers playing cards. They tried to get up and grab their weapons, but, finding themselves at gunpoint before they could move, thought better of it, slowly raising their hands. The rest of the shore party entered. The room stood still, the threat of violence hung in the air. A single sound was all it took, a boiling kettle and a Chilean flinched, a burst of shots erupted and hit him in the chest. It took the prisoner one second to fall to the ground, his hand nervously grasping his shirt where he had been wounded, and in that second, the Argentine officer had already plotted his next course of action: he drew his pistol and shot the second prisoner in the head without hesitation.\n\nThe order was to leave no trace of the Chileans, and so the hut was burned to the ground and the corpses dumped at sea. Pascal tore down the Chilean flag as the last smolders died, and then, their job was done."

His brief vacation in Buenos Aires had brought back many memories, but his current task may very well be even more nostalgic. The Colonel had assigned him to use his extensive diplomatic contacts to curry favor with one of their Antarctic neighbors: Italy, Germany, or Japan. It brought him back to his early days in the foreign service in Switzerland, wining and dining with the diplomatic elite of those once stalwart allies.\n\nItaly seemed like the obvious choice, sharing extensive diplomatic ties and deeper blood ties to Argentina. Italy was a relative newcomer to the Antarctic, with only a meager base on Galindez Island, they nonetheless had much to offer the Argentines, and, as much as he was loath to admit it, they could use the surplus of Italian weaponry to supply their troops. At least the guns would be in the hands of the Colonel and not those navy goons.\n\nThe Reich had maintained amicable relations with Argentina for years, and was a key part of Beltramino's earlier diplomatic gamble to acquire their polar territories. Even now, the Germans had much to offer, in particular a surplus supply of icebreakers. Nonetheless, this option as well was not without its own ethical quandaries: Beltramino shuddered to think of the hundreds of slaves that had likely labored to create said ships.\n\nFinally, there was Japan, the enigmatic outsider. Beltramino knew little about the Japanese, or at least far less than their robust spy networks knew about him. What he was certain of however is the potential Japan offered to diplomatically pressure the neighboring Chilean territory in Argentina's favor, or at the very least provide useful intelligence. Despite his natural inclinations towards diplomatic over matériel support, he wondered if he could ever truly trust the Japanese, or if Argentina was to be just another stone on their Go board.

The group known as Partisan Formation 13 had been growing increasingly bold in recent months, and Kraus feared he might just catch a bullet in some dark alleyway one day.\n\nWhen he returned to Germany, he'd be home, yes... but that sense of dread, the fear of what's around the corner would once again return to his life. The Reich's factionalism was growing and Kraus was terrified of what might happen once the beloved Führer passed on.\n\nCaptain Kraus's melancholic musings were disrupted when his first mate handed him a telegram.\n\n"The ship's being sold to Argentina?" gasped Kraus, as he read it. The ship was to be handed off to the Argentinians so that they could use it in Antarctica. After they dropped the Eisgleiter off at Ushuaia, the crew was to fly home to Germany.\n\nThinking about his orders, he came to a realization: He didn't want to go home. It felt wrong to even think it... but it was the truth. He just wished he could disappear and never return to that terrible place.\n\nKraus realized he didn't have to go back. He could just slip off the ship when they docked and find some place nice and warm in Argentina, live the rest of his life there in peace.\n\n"Captain, are you ok?" said his first mate.\n\n"I think I'm going to be just fine," Kraus said, a faint smile creeping across his lips."

A sense of relief washed over him when Shimoda offered his hand to shake instead. Shimoda exchanged pleasantries in near perfect, yet stilted Spanish, almost certainly thoroughly rehearsed.\n\nBeltramino led the delegation into the base, passing the military checkpoints, and into the HQ building. The Japanese delegation followed Beltramino through the winding corridors of the building with an unexpected grace, seeming to not need to look for him for guidance, almost as if they were already versed in the layout of the base.\n\nOnce they arrived in Beltramino's office, Shimoda placed a large suitcase on the table and unveiled a miniature library's worth of maps, diagrams, and reports concerning the Chilean territories. Several hours were spent going over the information, but something in particular caught Beltramino's eye, though: a map of Chilean defenses, dotted with areas of vulnerability. It brought back memories of something he saw in a Japanese cultural primer he had been reading in preparation, specifically an acupuncture chart. Meant to aid the practitioner in finding specific nerve areas to strike with their needle for maximum effect, the knowledge of where to poke to bring relief and where to inflict pain.

For now, they could only listen to the ice crunching under their boots, and the howling of the wind.\n\nA huge banner hung above the largest of the orange buildings. "BIENVENIDOS A SAN MARTÍN."

Now, it seemed it would finally serve its purpose.\n\nColonel Leal had put Giró in command of the base and instructed him to coordinate with Olezza on three objectives: conduct aerial reconnaissance and foot patrols to find a suitable route to the pole through the great rift, locate protected locations for supply dumps, and decide on the location of Sub-Base Sobral.\n\nSobral would be a relay between Belgrano and the pole, a place where they could repair snowcats, store supplies, and exchange manpower with the four men intended to be stationed there. Operación 90 could not work without Sobral.\n\nAs Giró and Olezza stepped down from the airplane, they beheld a series of orange structures almost entirely buried by snow and ice. "You'd almost think it was abandoned," said Olezza. Both men knew already that most of the base was underground, and linked by a web of tunnels, some buried as far as ten meters under the snow.

Any energy not spent on fighting the elements was energy wasted, in Leal's opinion.\n\nBut Leal was a realist. It was Mankind's nature to take its conflicts wherever it went, and it would be naive to think Antarctica was somehow different than every other disputed territory on this planet. If push came to shove, Leal would shove hard.\n\nThis place was part of Argentina, and he'd make sure the nations of the world came to realize that. He'd prefer to do it with words and goodwill, but if needs must, bullets and scorn would suffice.\n\nOperación 90 itself lay at the heart of this personal dilemma.

He'd chosen to bring a fifth man for the final march to the pole, when they'd only planned for four. Heating the extra food for that fifth man was thought to have been part of the reason for their untimely demise.\n\nA crucial factor in any Antarctic planning was the integrity of the food supplies. Canned beef, hardtack, pemmican, all had to be checked regularly to make sure they didn't spoil.\n\nColonel Leal had chosen to bring an extra tranche of food supplies instead of heavy weaponry, and had opted to inspect every food item individually.

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.460.desc:0 "Colonel Leal studied the names on the corkboard in his office. Over the past year, he'd put together the best soldiers Argentine Antarctica had to offer. They would be the core of the assault on the pole. They would set out together from Belgrano, and God willing, achieve the aims of Operación 90. An Argentine flag at the South Pole would be a sight to behold, Leal thought to himself, but getting there would be solely dependent on CWO Ceppi, and his mechanics, Bulacio, Rodriguez, and Ortiz. They would be the ones to ensure the snowcats didn't succumb to the brutal environs of the Antarctic circle.\n\nFinding their way, of course, would be up to the capable First Sergeants Carrion and Moreno, seasoned navigators who would not only guide them, but draw up new maps of the territory.\n\nAnd of course there was First Sergeant Zacarias and Corporal Alfonso, who would keep them in communication with the other elements of the Operación, and deter any armed opposition from the other claims, respectively.\n\nThen, finally, there was Captain Giró, and Leal himself. Leal had no doubts that Giró would prove an indefatigable second, and should the worst befall Leal's person, Giró would achieve the dream they'd hoped for for so long.\n\nSpeak of the Devil, Leal thought, as Giró entered the HQ of Esperanza, having just flown in from Belgrano."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.470.desc:0 "December on the Antarctic Peninsula was a lovely time, compared to the rest of the year and the rest of the continent. The northernmost piece of Antarctica currently enjoyed a balmy 0 to 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nThis factor made the Peninsula the most easily inhabited part of the continent year round. Many of Argentine Antarctica's bases retained personnel compliments through winter and summer. However, this summer, Colonel Leal, Captain Giró, and the rest of the Operación 90 team were heading home for some well-deserved R&R.\n\nLeal saluted Brigadier General Pujato on the runway at Esperanza, concluding the formal handover of command. Pujato would represent the interests of the Argentine Antarctica Institute; of that, Leal had no doubt. "So, what are your plans when you arrive in Ushuaia?" Pujato asked.\n\n"I have half a mind to chew out whoever organized our last few supply deliveries," said Leal, "Seems the Navy got gear that was meant for us."\n\n"I doubt that was an accident..."\n\n"Naturally. Keep an eye on them. This isn't the first 'incident', and it won't be the last."\n\nAs both men bade farewell, Vice Commodore Olezza started the plane's engine."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.480.desc:0 "The town of Ushuaia was known as Argentina's gateway to Antarctica. It was a critical hub for almost all supplies and manpower entering the southern continent. It was also a major naval base for controlling the Beagle Channel, the Drake Passage and the many archipelagos to the south. An argument could be made that Ushuaia was the only reason Argentine Antarctica survived.\n\nColonel Leal had grown to fear the navy's domination of the town. Year by year, the Argentine Antarctic Institute's control of supply throughput had been supplanted by naval officers eager to siphon resources for their own machinations.\n\nTheir presence in Ushuaia felt like a hand at Leal's throat, tightening a little more each day.\n\nAs Leal and the Operación 90 South Pole Assault Group made their way through the streets of the town, they felt a distinct tension in the air, like the taste of ozone before a storm.\n\nThe political conflicts within the Argentine government were reaching a fever pitch, and one could see evidence of it everywhere. On the faces of civilians, in the newspapers, in the way soldiers looked at one another.\n\nEven though it was far from the center of government, Ushuaia's nature as a hub of the Argentine Navy placed it in the eye of the oncoming storm. It was almost as if the town itself could feel the impending doom, the buildings casting darker shadows as they loomed large over empty streets.\n\nMaking their way to midtown, and hopefully a drink, Leal saw a few naval officers drinking coffee in sidewalk cafes. The officers gave Leal's men dark looks. One of them clearly caught Captain Giró's eye.\n\n"Just keep walking, Captain," said Leal."

There weren't many taverns that weren't crawling with navy personnel, so the team had found a hole in the wall basement bar that had long since seen better days.\n\n"Tell me you'll at least try to relax on your time off," said Giró.\n\n"Sadly, I think I'll be spending my Christmas leave from Antarctica pacing the halls of the AAI, begging for scraps," said Leal, "Beltramino tells me the navy has been quite active in siphoning supplies and money earmarked for us."\n\n"They're trying to run us out of the Administration."\n\n"Let me worry about it for now. You worry about enjoying your vacation," Leal hoisted his glass, "To the team of Operación 90."\n\nGiró clinked his glass against Leal's, "I think it's time for the picture, before the men get too drunk."

They'd been so committed to these discoveries that they continued to carry the heavy rock samples even when it became clear their survival was in jeopardy.\n\nLeal fully intended to bring every man back alive, and have something more to show for the journey than a flag, beloved as it might be.\n\nTo that end, he'd put together a subteam called Patrol 82, whose job it would be to precede the South Pole Assault across the Great Rift, planting markers along the best route through to the Polar Plateau that could be traversed by snowcats without the heavy vehicles falling into crevasses.\n\nAfterwards, the team, comprising Lieutenant Adolfo Eugenio Goetz, the commander, First Sergeant Ramon Villar, and First Corporals Marcelo Enoc Alvarez and Leonardo Isabel Guzman, would break off and explore the Santa Fe Range, collecting rock samples from a place never before visited by humans. Leal had confidence in Patrol 82, and even felt a measure of excitement for what they might discover. Some scientists believed Antarctica was once a lush jungle paradise.

The plane touched down, and the South Pole Assault Group dispersed to resume their duties in preparation for Operación 90. Leal and Giró got off the plane and strolled down the runway towards Esperanza. Waiting at the end was Brigadier General Pujato. As the two men drew closer to him, they saw a dour look etched upon his face. "What happened?" asked Leal.\n\n"Come with me," said Pujato, leading them to the HQ. When they got inside, Pujato locked the door. "Sit down." Leal did so, his heart rate starting to rise. Giró followed suit.\n\n"The ARA Rosario, based out of San Martín, was conducting a series of flag-planting operations throughout the Palmer Archipelago. A shore party on Wiencke Island encountered a Chilean outpost. An altercation occurred and one Chilean was shot. Dead. The sub-lieutenant in charge of the shore party ordered the execution of the other Chilean soldier and then proceeded to set fire to the outpost and dump everything that didn't burn completely into the sea... including the Chileans."\n\nLeal felt like he'd been punched in the gut. He looked to his right. All the color had drained from Giró's face. "That... constitutes an act of war. Cold-blooded murder. Who told you this?"\n\n"Second Sailor Lugo Pascal, a young member of the shore party. His conscience was greater than his loyalty to his captain.

Now, it loomed ominously, like the bars of a prison, trapping the army and personnel of the AAI in their bases.\n\n"The navy could strangle us," Leal said suddenly, "It wouldn't even have to be overt. A missed food shipment here and there, slightly less fuel than needed. Antarctica would do the rest."\n\nPujato nodded slowly. "Only you, me, and Giró know about Wiencke Island. We need to keep it that way until after the Operación. If the navy finds out we're onto them..." He left the rest unsaid. " In the meantime, while we prepare for the Operación, we need to establish critical supply redundancy using the Air Force. You must set Olezza to the building of clandestine aerial supply lines. We need to make the navy believe they still hold our fate in their hands. I'll try to transfer as many army personnel into my command as possible. That shouldn't look too strange, considering my previous efforts to reinforce San Martín."\n\n"The navy were fools to think your buildup was oriented against the Chileans," said Leal.\n\nPujato smiled. "And here I was, thinking I was being discreet. Naturally, I'm still hoping to avoid a fight, but should the navy attack San Martín, my men and I will be ready."

Carro managed a small fleet of prop aircraft responsible for carrying supplies to a few Argentine bases. Leal met Carro in his office, a hut smaller than anything at Esperanza, to discuss the prospect of expanding operations at Matienzo.\n\n"I'll be blunt, sir," said Carro, "What you're proposing simply isn't feasible here. Matienzo can't support anything larger than a Douglas C-47, and then only a couple at a time. We could run a few more Beavers out of here, give you some breathing room at least..."\n\nLeal nodded, "That would be enough for now, until we locate a site for a bigger airfield.

During the summer, melting ice revealed crystal clear water across the inlets of Antarctica.\n\nWhile it was a great day for sightseeing, Olezza had an important job to do. Colonel Leal had informed him this morning that an American flotilla had entered Argentine Antarctica's littoral. Multiple vessels had violated their territorial waters and were cutting a long, deliberate course along the Palmer Archipelago.\n\nOlezza recalled his orders: "I've gotten the navy to listen to me for once," Leal had said, "and they're standing down. Seems even they're not foolish enough to challenge the Americans. But I want someone from our quarter keeping an eye on things."\n\nFierce headwinds buffeted the small frame of the Beaver. Olezza got close enough to spy a Rear Admiral's flag flying from a cruiser, probably the American Reedy based out of McMurdo. A fellow pilot who had accomplished some feats of his own in Antarctic flight, making the first aerial crossing from Cape Town, South Africa to McMurdo Station on Ross Island.\n\nThank God the navy listened to reason, Olezza thought. This could've gone really badly. As it stood now, the American flotilla was on a course to leave Argentine waters. He decided to trail it for an hour, and then fly home."

I want an hour of practice every day. Today, we'll be man-hauling."\n\nMan-hauling. It was the last resort of any Antarctic explorer, or should be. Scott failed to appreciate that. He'd romanticized the physical exertion of hauling, of men pulling their supplies behind them on sleds, straps in hand, over thousands of kilometers, braving the elements. Antarctica took no pity when it snuffed them out.\n\nAmundsen, by contrast, had used the threat of his man-hauling yokes as a punishment for his dog sled teams should the huskies fail the expedition. Leal intended to emulate Amundsen. The experience man-hauling in training would hopefully motivate the men to ensure that the snowcats and the dog sleds never failed them.\n\nAs they began to haul their sleds, a courier came running out of Esperanza's communications building, half dressed, waving a piece of paper frantically.

However, I wanted to talk about our exchange," Lieutenant Zavala wanted to speak, but he knew Admiral Torrisi was getting to the point. The Admiral reached for his glass of whiskey, and took a sip. "Now, I understand this exchange is... inequitable. It will need to be repaid with a future favor."\n\n"You're an astute man, Admiral. What kind of repayment did you have in mind?" Zavala inquired.\n\nTorrisi sighed, "As I take it, your superior is getting ready to..." Torrisi searched his vocabulary, "Make his mark. I believe that's what they say in English. No matter, what I'm saying is that Colonel Leal is going to be away from his command for an extended period of time. Any number of people could come for his post, maybe even try and sabotage his expedition," Admiral Torrisi looked up from his glass, and stared at Zavala, who was shifting in his chair, "Please tell the Colonel we will oppose anyone who tries to oust him in his absence.""

Despite Lieutenant Zavala's resistance, he was eventually forced to tow the line and deny the much-needed assistance the Italians required.\n\nAdmiral Torrisi sighed, it was a near-constant downpour on Galindez Island. Everything was water-logged by now. Even his office, located at the highest point on the island, was starting to leak. However, the Italian's interminable stint in Antarctica was about to improve... albeit slightly. A young soldier stepped into his office, reporting an Argentine ship docked in the harbor. It was unloading supplies. Had Colonel Leal finally come around? Curious, Admiral Torrisi invited the Captain of the ship into his office.\n\n"So, I take it Colonel Leal finally came around?" Admiral Torrisi said.\n\nCaptain Massera chuckled, "Afraid not, I'm acting on behalf of the Navy. I wish it weren't so, but it seems Colonel Leal has ignored your request for aid. Once we found out the Army failed to help out our newfound neighbors... We stepped in."\n\nTorrisi nodded, all too familiar with the game, "I see. I'll be straightforward then. I do not know what the Admiralty plans are, but whatever you decide to do while Leal's away on his expedition, we'll look the other way. Might even do more if you keep the supplies rolling in."\n\nMassera smiled, "I see. My shipmates will be happy to hear of this development. I'm afraid I must be going now, but I'm glad we had the chance to... establish an understanding."\n\nCaptain Massera extended his hand to Admiral Torrisi and the two navy men shook hands."

Captain Emilio Massera cut a striking figure as he walked up the gangplank from the docks of Brown Station. For several days now, ships of various ages and sizes had been arriving to join the Almirante Brown Naval Detachment. Massera's command was growing.\n\nSecond Sailor Lugo Pascal grit his teeth in the face of another freezing gust. The inspection was meticulous. Massera intended to examine every gun, every weld and bolt, every post on the ship, clearly taking stock of all the resources at his disposal. The crew of the Rosario, normally prone to griping, remained resolute in the face of the cold, a sign of respect, even admiration, for their new commander.\n\nRumor had percolated throughout the Rosario that Massera had conducted multiple successful offensive operations during the Italo-Turkish war, striking at maritime commerce and sharing the booty liberally with his crew. Some men would appreciate such a piratical commander, eager to share the spoils, many more seemed drawn to Massera's penchant for the attack.\n\nMassera drew along the line, inspecting each sailor, before saluting and offering them a firm handshake.

The worst came to pass more often than not, and one had to be prepared for the extremes of the continent.\n\nEvacuation routes, fuel dumps, and emergency rations all had to be established. Even secondary refuges were necessary. Accidental fires were not uncommon in Antarctica, with the use of so many personal heaters and gas-powered portable stoves indoors. The continent's dry climate meant that it was difficult to put out a raging flame.\n\nLeal wished a fire was the most he had to contend with.\n\nNow, the worst had indeed come to pass, just as Pujato said it would. The navy had missed a supply delivery for Operación 90. They hadn't even bothered to offer an excuse. Radio silence was the order of the day. While today's delivery was not crucial to the running of Esperanza, it would impede the preparations for the expedited start date of the polar assault.\n\nLeal was faced with a dilemma. Esperanza did have an emergency refuge stocked with supplies: General Martín Güemes II. Leal himself had created it after the first refuge had been swallowed by ice. He could dip into the supplies there to give the Operación a better chance, but it could imperil Esperanza if any additional crisis developed."

First Wiencke, then the San Martín naval attaché took the last boat out, and now the navy had not resupplied Esperanza.\n\nPujato reasoned it was unlikely they'd supply San Martín base either, come summer. The navy had abandoned their landward fellows.\n\nHe set the message on fire and walked out of the radio room into the darkening Antarctic night. Pujato had lived through many a winter in this place, but he feared this might be the worst of all. With no guarantee of resupply from the water, and limited aerial capacity, San Martín and all of its inhabitants would have to rely on their existing supply stores.\n\nPujato was now faced with the most harrowing choice any Antarctic explorer had to make: whether to reduce rations.\n\nReducing caloric intake meant the men could do less work, but provided more flexibility when summer arrived to sort out logistics issues.

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.690.desc:0 "During the Age of Sail, the most successful captains were the ones who engaged in legal piracy. When you served a country as master and commander on the high seas, your word was law. A captain was a God of his ship, the only morality that mattered was his own. The captains who made a name for themselves did so by ruthlessly hunting down the maritime commerce of the enemy, disposing of the enemy, taking as much loot as possible and even the ships themselves. Such conduct was frowned upon by weaker men in the current epoch, and Captain Emilio Massera bemoaned that fact.\n\nThe Captain had a rare moment now to walk the decks of the ARA Almirante Brown undisturbed. Most of the crew were enjoying a party in Brown Station at Massera's expense. For some, it might be their last drink.\n\nThe 10,000 tonne heavy cruiser had been laid down in 1927 in Italy, and was commissioned by the Argentine navy four years later. She saw no combat during the Second World War, as Argentina stood on the sidelines while the world burned. Her first taste of battle was in 1958 during the Snipe Incident. The Almirante Brown and its sister ship took part in the rapid annexation of Chilean holdings, however it suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of Captain Merino of Chile, and had been forced to undergo extensive repairs.\n\nMassera paced along the forecastle, in front of the three twin 7.5 inch naval guns. He would use these weapons to shatter any opposition on the water or fortifications landward. Bofors AA guns lined the forecastle at deck level, and would, with good aim, afford a measure of protection against any fixed wing aircraft Chilean Antarctica might have up its sleeves.\n\nMassera paused and stared into the Antarctic night. He was still getting used to this place. Its remoteness was a blessing and a curse for his aspirations. He was thankful that the Brown had received its float plane catapult upgrade. Reconnaissance would be essential in this wasteland."

"Come on!" the man shouted, "We're underway!"\n\nReality finally broke through the last dregs of sleep, and Pascal showed a leg, getting into uniform in record time. The ship's archaic klaxon wheezed an ugly drone through the decks as the crew, in its entirety, rushed to their posts. Pascal made his way through cramped, damp hallways, shoving past men headed in the opposite direction, and emerged into the annihilating cold of the Antarctic winter. Another sailor passed him a life vest.\n\nAcross the bay, he saw the Almirante Brown Naval Detachment in all its strength, with its namesake shaking off the rime, still trapped within the pack ice. Where the fuck does Massera expect us to go? Pascal wondered.\n\nHis question was answered as explosive charges detonated across the ice in a drumroll of white debris, rippling past and around the trapped ships. The crew held its breath, all of them watching the Almirante Brown. Suddenly, the heavy cruiser lurched, gaining enough momentum to break free of its prison. The entire fleet let out a cheer, thousands of voices lifting to the Aurora Australis above. The flotilla's icebreakers moved to the fore and began the laborious task of clearing a channel through the ice.\n\nPascal walked to his post on one of the Rosario's two howitzers in a daze.

He'd been in rough seas, with waves fifty feet tall, and that was less stressful than the haggard procession of Argentine warships through the Antarctic sea ice.\n\nIce breakers took the lead, ramming full speed through and over the ice, using their bulk to crack open leads that the rest of the flotilla could follow.\n\nThe ARA Almirante Brown sailed second in the procession, followed by the smaller ships, all of which were ice strengthened, with additional ribbing, thicker hulls, and reinforced ice belts around the ships one meter above and below the water line.\n\nEven with the Antarctic retrofitting, the ARA Rosario was showing its age. It was built for riverine operations, not traversing frozen Antarctic seas in the dead of winter. Pascal felt each knock and jolt from the chunks of ice that struck the hull. The smallest piece could rattle the Rosario to her bones.\n\nNone of the rest of the crew seemed to share his concerns. They were buoyed along by the daring of their commander aboard the Brown.

The leads had closed, and no amount of struggling could free the ships.\n\nThe crews just had to wait and pray the ice conditions changed with the weather. The clock was ticking. As winter intensified, the ice thickened, and the possibility of the ships being crushed by the heaving floes increased.\n\nThe first ships to go would be ones like the Rosario; old ships that weren't purpose built for polar seas. Even the impressive heavy cruiser ARA Almirante Brown would be crushed like a tin can if it lingered too long. Crushing aside, a secondary fear was that the floes themselves would begin to migrate, carrying and scattering the flotilla. The ship's stores of food and fuel were not endless either, and they did not have enough to make it through the winter out here.\n\nMassera and his commanders had teams out on the ice sawing it with hand tools and deploying explosive charges to try and expose leads. Each detonation sent teeth-rattling vibrations through the hulls of the ships. For now, nothing seemed to shake Antarctica's grip on these wayward vessels.\n\nPascal lay in his bunk, wide awake, listening to the mournful howls of the Rosario, like the death throes of a once magnificent beast.

It wasn't merely the disheveled hairs descending from his face in a scraggly beard, the bloodshot eyes, or the cheeks scarred by frostbite. There was a fear in his eyes, a fear instilled by the continent outside his cabin. His flotilla had been trapped in the ice for days... no, weeks now. Massera had accounted for all his enemies except for the most immediate one: Antarctica. Already the continent had begun to press its advantage. The ships trapped in the ice had been carried apart from each other by the floes. A few had been lost entirely, though whether carried beyond the horizon or crushed and sent to the depths, none could tell. It was like watching a battle play out, only a thousand times more slowly than on a human scale, and the ice was winning. There was a knock at the cabin door. "Come," said Massera.\n\nThe frostbitten form of one of Massera's ice masters entered the room. They'd been working day and night to find leads, gaps in the ice the ships could punch through. "Captain, we've found a lead. It's less than a kilometer away, and even the Almirante Brown could fit through it..." The ice master paused.\n\n"What else?" Massera asked.\n\n"The only ships that can reach it are the Almirante Brown, the Rosario, and our designated ice breaker, San Martín. The rest of the flotilla is too far from the lead, and trapped in thicker ice than us. They won't be able to generate enough thrust to break free of their ice, let alone make the lead before it closes, and it is closing."\n\n"So... we'll lose a destroyer, two corvettes, two icebreakers, and a fuel ship." That's a significantly smaller force than Massera was hoping to bring to bear against the Chileans, but still... the element of surprise would be theirs.

The whole crew could feel it.\n\nThe crew quarters were cramped at the best of times, but it was even worse with the complement of marines installed for the assault on Adelaide Island. They, along with the sailors, were now assembled to hear the plan of attack, from Captain Massera himself. He'd come over from the Almirante Brown to personally address the men, and to ensure they were clear on his orders.\n\n"Our assault will begin by maneuvering the Almirante Brown into a position with a firing solution on Adelaide Base, out of sight of any landward defenses they might have. I will then launch the Grunman Float Planes for a strike on their radio facilities, severing them from the outside world.\n\n"For the second phase of the attack, we have caught another break, men. The ice around Adelaide Island is strewn with leads and even a few nearly ice-free passages. The San Martín can force a break through towards Adelaide Base, while the Rosario follows closely behind. The task will then fall to the Rosario's tenders to transport the marine complement onto the icebound shores of the island. From there, the Rosario will provide covering fire while the radio-equipped sailors in the landing parties provide a firing solution for the Almirante Brown's guns.\n\n"By day's end, the island will belong to Argentina.""

It'd taken them two hours to clear the ice and snow off the launch system, but even then, Ramos was terrified that the machine wouldn't work. Ice... he'd learned to fear it during the flotilla's imprisonment. He wondered where the other ships of the flotilla ended up, or if any still floated.\n\nThe deck crew gave him the thumbs up as the propellers of the G-21 Goose spun to life. He turned his head towards the bombs mounted under the wings, hoping they actually deployed when the time came. A moment later, Ramos was slammed back into his seat as the catapult fired him into the sky.\n\nRamos circled what was left of the Almirante Brown Naval Detachment as he waited for the second Grunman to take off. Soon, both birds soared high above the ice. It was a dark twilight hour, the faintest glimmer of the sun over the horizon casting long, foreboding shadows across Adelaide Island. He wished he could just stay up here, far above this wretched place.\n\nThe radio receiver crackled, "Commence bombing run."\n\nRamos took the rear, following his wingman in over Adelaide Base from the landward side. His jaw fell open. It was not the same base from the recon photos taken in summer. Trench lines and sandbag positions dotted the coast, with machine gun emplacements, and what he thought was a naval cannon. He only had seconds until the lead plane dropped its payload.\n\nThe lead plane scored a direct hit on the radio antenna as it passed over. Ramos quickly followed suit, landing a hit on the communications building, turning it to a fireball that lit up the base. In the brief flash, Ramos spotted an anti-aircraft gun, taking aim at him.

Some had died of blood poisoning. Pascal on the other hand, was lucky enough to have a front row seat to Massera's insanity.\n\nThe marines and sailors accompanying them had stripped the Rosario's tenders, removing propellers, both to reduce noise, and to avoid damaging them in the ice-filled waters off Adelaide Island. They'd rowed, dragged the boats over ice floes, and rowed some more. Now, they were in the final stretch to the shore. Five hundred meters of mostly open water lay between them and their objective.\n\nThey slipped the boats off the last ice floe into the water and began rowing. Moments later, they heard the propellers of the Grunman Float Planes moving in for their strike. The first bomb went off, and Pascal was blinded by the flash in the dark. The radio tower crumpled beneath the first plane's ordinance, and then the signals building erupted into flame under the following plane. The crew of Pascal's boat watched in horror as the Chileans unleashed AA fire into the sky and brought down the second float plane. Shouts echoed across the water as floodlights illuminated the Argentine marine assault.\n\nMachine gun fire ripped across the water, savaging the boat ahead of Pascal's.

Out of an assault force of seven boats, each carrying ten marines and two sailors, five had made it to the beach. The other two drifted on the water, their hulls riddled with bullets and laden with corpses.\n\nThe machine gun positions laid down withering fire, suppressing the assault force on the beach. The defenders remained undeterred by the fire consuming their base. Pascal pulled the radio kit off his back and hailed the captain of the Rosario. "This... Rosario, this is Pascal, requesting fire support. Two machine gun nests a hundred meters up the beach from our position, past the trench line. Danger close." More machine gun fire cut him off. A burst of fire amputated a marine's arm at the elbow. Pascal almost threw up.\n\nThe receiver crackled, "Copy that, danger close."\n\nPascal grit his teeth and made himself as small as possible, "Heads down!" he called out, "Bombardment incoming!" The Rosario's old howitzers roared to life, sending two shells over the trench line and into the Chileans' machine gun nests. Mud and blood rained down over the battlefield. The machine gun fire stopped.\n\nBut the Chileans had their own answer to the howitzers. Hidden by the spur of the far hill, a naval gun spat a retort across the harbor, scoring a direct hit on the front howitzer of the Rosario. The blast sounded a split second after the flash. And just like that, Pascal's compatriots on the gun crew were atomized.\n\nPropelled by rage, he reported the naval guns position to the Almirante Brown."

For a moment it seemed like the battle was over, all forces cowed before the might of the offshore cruiser.\n\nThe Argentinian marines were the first to recover, charging up the beach with fixed bayonets, eager to come to grips with their tormentors. Pascal followed his own assault team into the fray, making for a shell hole in the side of the trench line.\n\nAs the Argentinian forces moved up the beach, the shell-shocked Chileans began to return fire, and then proceeded to launch their own countercharge down the beach. Perhaps they were out of ammo, perhaps they felt the bloodlust as keenly as their enemies.\n\nBattlecries rose from all as the two lines crashed into melee combat on what was left of the trench line. The marine in front of Pascal parried with his bayonet, and drove deep into his heart, taking his attacker to the ground. A split second later, another Chilean disembowelled the marine and leaped at Pascal, dragging him into the shell hole.\n\nPascal grappled with the Chilean, using his rifle as a shield. His foe had lost his rifle, and was using his hands to claw and slash at Pascal's face. He took a chunk out of the Second Sailor's cheek, but Pascal kicked the man off him to the opposite side of the hole.\n\nHe leveled his rifle at his attacker, and the Chilean raised his hands.

It was not yet clear what the death toll would be tomorrow, but either way, this was a disaster... for Massera. He'd launched this attack, without orders, on the expectation of total victory, but nature, and man, had ruined his plans. At least he'd exterminated the perfidious Chileans.\n\nMassera made his way into Adelaide Base, flanked by his guards. The marines and sailors saluted as he passed, but he could see malice in the eyes of more than a few. A pyrrhic victory was not what he'd promised the men. With the few ships and land forces that made it to the island, they would not be able to garrison this place. They lacked the food, fuel, and ammunition to hold it. When the Chileans returned in the summer, recapturing Adelaide Island would be child's play.\n\nMassera approached the supply depot. During the battle, the flames started by the bomb strikes on the communications building had spread to the nearby hybrid barracks-supply depot. He could see, through the burned wreckage of the building, a small hill of charred corpses piled up near the door to the armory. That was a stroke of luck; if those men had reached their weapons, the battle might have gone differently.\n\nAs the smoke wafted up from the hollow eye sockets of the bodies and entered Massera's lungs, he began to formulate a new plan. His men could make this look like an accident. If they filled in every crater, disposed of all the bodies with combat trauma, and collected every single spent casing and shell fragment, this might just look like an unfortunate fire. Massera's ships could slip away and, to the Chileans and the rest of the world, there never was a Battle of Adelaide Island.

He still tasted blood. He struggled to change; the simplest tasks became depressingly difficult since the surgeons amputated his right index finger and left thumb. They'd left his hands intact just long enough for him to aid in the "cleanup" of Adelaide Island. Massera and the men had combed the entire battlefield, correcting any signs of armed conflict. They'd buried the mountain of charred Chileans, making it look like the final act of the base's survivors before they'd fled for want of food.\n\nPascal managed to get into warm, dry clothes, donned his greatcoat, and went on-deck, or what was left of it. His gunmates were gone, the forward howitzer destroyed. Pascal had spent the hours before his amputation desperately scrubbing their remains from the forecastle. They'd dumped what was left of them, along with all the battle-scarred Chileans and Argentine marine corpses, into the water.\n\nPascal grabbed the railing as the Rosario shook. It was following close behind the San Martín. They'd both managed to break free of the ice before it trapped them at Adelaide. Massera and the Almirante Brown, on the other hand, were stuck in a floe that was moving northward, far from the icebreaker. He'd ordered them to make way to the nearest naval facility. Pascal doubted they'd make it."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.810.desc:0 "Icebound, again. And this time, it was the end of the ARA Rosario.\n\nThe crew had been stuck for days, watching the icebreaker San Martín, their only chance of salvation, drift away on the floes, as trapped and helpless as the Rosario.\n\nFood and fuel had nearly run out, and it was getting harder and harder to stay warm. The men were sick. Some showed the early stages of scurvy, others were confined to their cots, suffering a slow death from frostbite. There would be mutinous talk, if any had the energy to spare, both against their captains, and at Emilio Massera for putting them here.\n\nThe captain of the Rosario was nearly comatose, seemingly degrading in body along with his ship. The gunboat was tilted at an obscene angle, forcing the few men who could still walk to maneuver through the corridors using the buckling walls for support.\n\nThere'd been some discussion about transferring to the San Martín, as she was a much stronger ship and still seaworthy, but no one wanted to abandon the sick and the injured. They all crowded together for warmth in the crew quarters, doubling up in the cots. It wouldn't be long now, before the continent consumed them.\n\nEarly one morning, Pascal and a number of others were summoned to the bedside of the captain, who, according to the ship's doctor, wouldn't see another sunless day. "Massera led us to our doom," the captain rasped, "I shouldn't have followed him. No one should've. The man is a monster."\n\nHe paused, wracked by a coughing fit that shook the cot. "Enough," he said. "I want you to get the radio running, and contact San Martín Base. If anyone has a chance of saving you, it will be the Conqueror of the White Desert. Forgive me, boys... forgive me...""

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.820.desc:0 "Brigadier General Pujato raced across the ice on a dog sled. He'd put together a small convoy of the craft and departed San Martín six hours ago with emergency medical aid, clothing, and food. This was something he would never have guessed he'd be doing after the year he and Leal had had: he was rushing to help the navy.\n\nA distress call had come through over the radio a few days ago. It was faint, and garbled, but the substance of it could be made out. There were two Argentine navy vessels icebound off the coast of San Martín Base: the ARA Rosario, and the ARA San Martín. Pujato was familiar with both vessels. The Rosario was based out of San Martín last year, and had been the epicenter of the Wiencke Island Incident.\n\nThe San Martín was an icebreaker Pujato himself had acquired and used during the fifties to establish many of Argentine Antarctica's bases. Last he'd heard of these ships, they were based out of Brown Station, and had no business being out here. The navy was up to something.\n\nAs the sleds tore across the ice, Pujato reflected on the wonder of the Antarctic winter, and the thrill of exploring this place once again.\n\nAt the same time, he felt the weight of his years. He was fifty-nine, and every day he felt the cold more keenly than the last. A man of his age had no business being in such a hostile environment, but Pujato would not foist this task upon any other man.\n\nThis was a spectacularly rare chance to build a bridge between the Argentine Antarctic Administration and the navy, and he wanted to see it done himself. There was also a certain young sailor he hoped was still alive aboard the Rosario."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.830.t:0 "Rescue"
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.830.desc:0 "They called this hour Nautical Twilight. The sun was just barely above the horizon, turning the landscape into an alien terrain of shadows and blurry shapes. One such shape loomed above all the others: the canted hull of the ARA Rosario.\n\nThe distorted distress calls had not done justice to the severity of the fate that had befallen the gunboat. The ship would never see service again. If it wasn't crushed by the ice, it would sink when it thawed. The dog sleds fanned out as they approached the vessel. In the distance, Pujato could make out the unmistakable profile of the ARA San Martín.\n\nApproaching the Rosario, the rescue teams blew their whistles, yelling out identification and calling for the crew to present themselves. Several minutes passed. Then, on the partly-submerged quarterdeck, skeletal shapes appeared, climbing hand over hand along the railings. Another group of ghosts crawled out of a crack in the hull, slowly getting to their feet and shambling forward. Pujato directed one of his teams to continue on to the San Martín, whilst he moved forward to greet what was left of the Rosario's crew.\n\n"Where's the captain?" he asked the first man he saw, helping the sailor to stay on his feet.\n\n"Dead," the sailor croaked.\n\nPujato had felt the ravages of the continent himself, losing digits of his own. The emaciated forms in front of him horrified him. Flesh blackened from frostbite, once form-fitting uniforms dangling from the bodies like funerary rags. The dog teams distributed warm clothes, but on the advice of the doctors, refrained from feeding the crew. In their state, it would kill them. All the while, Pujato scanned the faces of the men for the young lad Pascal. He led a team into the sinking ship to rescue those who were bedridden, and there, laying in his cot, missing a few fingers, was Lugo Pascal."
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.830.a:0 ""It's going to be alright, son," Pujato whispered, "We're going home.""
 
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.840.t:0 "An Abominable Dilemma"
 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.840.desc:0 "It was early evening when Pujato's rescue convoy arrived at San Martín. It had not been an easy trip. The sailors were in very poor condition, and some hadn't survived the journey. Pujato resolved to bring them all home, both the living and the dead.\n\nDuring the return, Pujato had done his best to tease the full story of why the Rosario and the San Martín were outside their stations in winter out of the sailors. Some had clammed up immediately upon questioning, but others were practically chomping at the bit to tell Pujato what had happened on those ships. For some, it was the last story they ever told. Pujato had hoped to get a clearer picture from Pascal, but the Second Sailor had been slipping in and out of consciousness since the rescue.\n\nCaptain Massera had led the Almirante Brown Naval Detachment out of Brown Station for an attack on the Chilean Base on Adelaide Island. During the trip, several vessels were immobilized among the ice floes and were left behind. The attack itself was a mess, and suffered high casualties. In the aftermath, Massera had done his best to disguise the battleground and its casualties as an accident.\n\nPujato didn't believe the Chileans would buy it, in the long run. There were too many individuals party to the conspiracy who were willing to expose the truth. Massera had rewarded their loyalty with abandonment and callous disregard for the lives under his command. The ghosts of Adelaide were coming out of their graves sooner or later.\n\nPujato, in the here and now, wished to prevent any more deaths as a result of Massera's actions. He had medical supplies that might save the sailors who hovered on the brink, but the supplies were earmarked for Operación 90. Their absence might endanger the Polar Assault Team, and if they failed, Argentine Antarctica was doomed to succumb to the predations of the navy. Pujato was faced with an abominable dilemma."

They twinkled cold white and sparkling red, below them glaciers glowed in bluish hues against the darkness. Leal overlooked the void which in summer would be the bay outside Esperanza Base, now frozen and draped in black. Then a racket from outside his office broke the contemplation. Someone mumbled a curse as Leal stood up. The door swung open, revealing a heaving Hernán Pujato. He spit out ice, and grit his teeth, "I just came from San Martín," he snarled, "Massera attacked the Chileans on Adelaide Island, both sides sustained heavy casualties. Left the Rosario, the San Martín, and other ships stuck in the damn ice. I had to go and save the crews I could reach. This is... he really, I can't believe..."\n\nIce shards crackled under Pujato's boots as he paced around the room. A gaping hole, darker than the frozen bay, grew inside Leal's chest as he listened to the story. Argentine soldiers lay dead at the bottom of the Antarctic seas. They may be unaware now, but would the Chileans retaliate later? The hole grew larger. Was war coming? It grew until it might consume him.\n\n"It flips our whole project on its head," Pujato said, stepping towards the windows. His shoulders hunched, he seemed calmer than before as shadows cut across his face, "It's clear that Massera does not care for Operación 90, or anything we want to build here."\n\nLeal did not say a word, a spark igniting inside him. It threatened to blow him and his whole life's work to smithereens. But it also beckoned him to fight. "The Operación must go forward," he finally said, "Regardless of what Massera will do." Pujato turned to look at him, and Leal considered his choices. Someone had to stay and track Massera's schemes. Perhaps too old for adventuring, Hernán Pujato could stay and be the key bishop on the board. Yet the Antarctic veteran might also be an essential member of Operación 90's crew. Arguably, he had been preparing for this mission longer than anyone else, and would motivate the men with his experience, and legend. Leal came forward, his choice made."

 antarctica_aaa_op90prep.860.desc:0 "A shadow receded over Hernán Pujato eyes as he stared off into the frozen ocean. Embers of orange and red turned gold as they climbed along the edges of the distant McClary Glacier. One of the first sunrises San Martín base had seen since winter had begun. Cold pristine air washed over the shore, its icy bite taunting Pujato. He let out a quiet sigh. He had laid his boots in this same bay over a decade ago, and planted the Argentine flag on these same rocky shores. Back then, he had thought it'd be the first of many. That one day, maybe, he'd be planting the blue and white at the very end of the world. At the South Pole. But Leal's order to stay had vanquished those hopes for good, and the chilly winds shook his aging bones harder than back then. Pujato was a good soldier, and he'd do what he was ordered to do. Even if he didn't like it. Someone had to watch over the butcher. Second Sailor Pascal approached him, his injured hand hidden under his coat. He had saggy wide eyes, surrounded by tired spirals. And although he was young, fine wrinkles appeared below his wild, unkempt hair. What had happened in Adelaide had not yet left him. Pujato wondered if it ever would. Pascal pointed to a small icebreaker clearing the bay, posing a silent question. He pointed with his uninjured hand. Pujato sighed, reminded of his own injury. "It's rations and military equipment," he said, "I haven't decided what to do with it yet. Original plan was to install a few more guns here at base."\n\nBoth men overlooked the defenses dotting the snowy islands. They were meant to defend them from external enemies, but Pujato wondered if he'd have to use them against Massera instead. At the same time, Leal and the Operación 90 crew could also make use of some extra military force.\n\n"I hope... I hope Esperanza is as well defended as this place," Pascal whispered, staring at the sunrise, "What if Massera tries to take it?" Pujato looked at him sadly. He had said very few words since he had woken up from the coma. And most of what he had said had been about Massera. Warnings. Concerns. Predictions. Pujato had been by his bedside, listening to him.

The Brigadier General held his head high, sharp eyes overlooking the snowy roads. "We've built a couple more personnel houses," Giró announced, pointing to four bright orange buildings in the distance. Pujato nodded thoughtfully as they descended down one of the tunnels. This was a new one too. Everywhere they went was new. It had been a long time since Pujato had stepped foot on Piedrabuena Bay, and the base he had founded here. His heart jumped at the sight of the snowcats and dogs crowding around the area. Belgrano was finally fulfilling the purpose he had imagined for it. The spearhead Argentina would plunge into the South Pole started here.\n\n"The laboratory has been improved too," Giró went on, smiling, "They're doing everything from astronomy to seismography in there. The power station is behind it. We built it last year. But let me show you the new coffee maker before we go."\n\nThere was pointing and cheering when they arrived at the coffee machine, around which the whole expedition team had crowded. He blinked as if he were just waking up, and a sudden weight fell upon his shoulders. The whole team was here. Including him. Operación 90 was finally happening. Hernán Pujato felt young for a split second, new and intrepid, but also nervous. He took a sip of the plain brown drink, left with a flat taste. Beside him crouched Corporal Oscar Ramón Alfonso, petting one of the dogs as it buried its fluffy head in his lap. Oscar called the dog by name. Restraining an uncomfortable sigh, Pujato reached out to the younger man, "Don't get too attached to 'em, alright lad?"\n\nThat was the one thing he could offer to this team. It was what they expected of him. Experience. Without looking at Oscar's wary eyes, he turned to address the team. "Well, my friends, I have enjoyed learning all of your names." The team cheered.

The ice tunnels beneath Belgrano were filled with a cornucopia of supplies, all of which had to be rigorously inspected and counted. The margin for error on the Operación was razor-thin, a single lost day of fuel, a broken dog sleds strap, or a jammed gun could spell death for the whole team.\n\nMoreover, as the field leader of the expedition, those deaths would be Giró's conscience. There was reason to feel gloomy about their chances, but Giró still felt a sense of almost giddy excitement through all the stress. As the world became more and more connected, the holes in the known world had shrunk, and with it the role of explorers like Giró. The monsters once painted on the edge of the map had slowly retreated into the darkness. Where Giró was headed was perhaps the last place on the earth's surface left in the darkness, the last monster lair, the South Pole.\n\nGiró was the final conquistador, the last of a long line of dragon slayers... well maybe not the sole heir to that title.\n\nFrom behind a pile of supplies, Giró's commander and friend Colonel Leal approached. His expression made Giró's heart sink and his gut tighten. "There has been an error in your calculations: the storage on the snowcat is not what you predicted it would be." Giró's face filled with dread and guilt as the optimism began to quickly dissolve.\n\nBut before Giró could offer any excuse or apology, Leal broke out into a grin and let out a hearty laugh. "We actually have more space than you predicted, so my dear captain, how should we take advantage of your most foolish error." Giró became infected with Leal's contagious smile and responded; he knew exactly how to fill this surplus."

The Antarctic peninsula took on a different character from above. The continent was truly full of life of the most hardy varieties. Vast colonies of penguins stippled the coastlines. Seals lounged on rocky outcroppings. Huge albatrosses swept over the plateaus. The occasional whale spout reminded you that life was even more abundant under the waters.\n\nThe few human shelters seemed at odds with the proliferation of animals below, clinging to the shore, and life itself. Olezza hoped the successful completion of his mission today would alleviate the burden faced by all of Argentine Antarctica. The establishment of a year-round airfield which could accommodate the largest of wheeled modern aircraft could reduce the logistic strain considerably. Finding a suitable site was his challenge.\n\nThis was his tenth sortie from Esperanza. Per Leal's orders, he was only able to squeeze these trips in between his duties to Operación 90. As he was flying over archipelagos that dotted the coastlines of the Trinity Peninsula, he spotted a landmass that was largely flat and free from the glaciers and mountains that dotted most Antarctic islands. He consulted his map and compass and saw that it was called Seymour Island. It certainly fit the bill for an airfield. Olezza was certain Leal would agree."

"Well, I've noticed you, the Colonel, and the Vice Commodore have seemed more... tense than usual."\n\n"They've begun throttling supply to army, air force, and AAI facilities across Argentine Antarctica.

He read more, there had been an increasing number of unconfirmed reports of OFN patrols and snowcats in Argentine territory.

An intercepted communiqué sent from Esperanza to somewhere in the Japanese sector indicated that not only was there a mole at base, but that Japanese had become fully aware of Operación 90.\n\nThe Japanese were, in too many ways, an unknown quantity on the continent. While they maintained friendly relations with Esperanza, their unclear motives and impeccable intelligence services gave their presence an ominous aura.\n\nThis breach in security could very well spell disaster for Leal's plans or mean absolutely nothing, but it was the uncertainty that troubled him. More worrying was the possibility of a mole. When their expedition began to travel to the pole, he would need to trust every member of the team with his life, but to know one of them might be a spy... was unsettling to say the least. If there were a mole he prayed it was someone other than his polar compatriots.\n\nNonetheless, Leal was not a man to dwell on such things and the morning exercises continued as planned. In a remote location miles from Esperanza, the daily exercises began. He had chosen a piece of particularly broken ground for the men to practice their skiing and driving skills over perilous irregular ice sheets. Reconnaissance south of Belgrano indicated kilometers of crevasses and vicious sastrugi, it would not be an leisurely drive.\n\nAn hour into the training the mechanical purring of the snowcats and strained grunts of his men received a new addition to their ramshackle orchestra, a low almost inaudible thrumming. Peering through his binoculars, Leal saw the source of the noise, the unmistakable design of a Japanese scout plane. Leal could deny it no longer."

On Juan Carlos Beltramino's desk lay old parchments, copies of diplomatic bulletins, and various papers, all important to their claim. Reaching for his loupe, he spent a moment considering cursive Spanish words scribbled on an old map fragment. He wrote down in his notebook important words and dates, hoping to reinforce the argument that Argentina's efforts in Antarctica were justified by historical precedence.\n\nIt proved to be a complex endeavor, as they had to reach back centuries. Beltramino was focused on a letter sent in 1778 to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, which highlighted the territorial reorganization in effect for the last two years, complete with broad descriptions of the new administrative boundaries, which could be interpreted as including Antarctica as well. Of course, it was undiscovered at the time. Beltramino's fixation on the letter made him miss the soft knock at his door, repeated twice before he finally noticed and lifted his head from his papers. His secretary entered, bearing a diplomatic communiqué.\n\nThe message was very succinct: the German ambassador in Buenos Aires knew of Operación 90. Roald Amundsen, a proud Aryan, belonged to the German Reich through his Norwegian nationality and had reached the Southern Pole first in 1911, consecrating the superiority of the Germanic race over the rest of the world. The note ended with a disappointed tone, the ambassador regretted that Argentina had not informed Germany of its ambitions at the Pole given their amicable relations. Both nations had to face the treachery of the Yankees in the cold expanses of Antarctica. However the German ambassador wished the Argentinians good luck: there was much to be gained, he stated, from working together...\n\nBeltramino laid down the note on his desk, his hand wobbling.

The sky turned dull blue as it rolled below the gray and white mounts surrounding the glimmering ice of McClary Glacier.\n\nBreathing in the cold, Pujato remembered the Santa Micaela, the cargo ship which first crossed the gray islands of Marguerite Bay in 1951. Over twelve days of arduous work after it anchored, Pujato would oversee the inauguration of San Martín Base. After that he was promoted to Brigadier General, and supervised the securing and unprecedented growth of Argentina's corner of the continent.\n\nSan Martín had been the center of this expansion. Its detailed weather reports were essential to perfect navigation and logistics across an increasingly interconnected peninsula. And like any proper vital chain link, Pujato had been careful to protect it. His sharp eye focused on the AA batteries and coastal artillery pieces dotting the islands around the bay. He knew by memory each battery, bunker, foxhole, and tunnel that surrounded his masterpiece.\n\nThis was how all of Argentina's Antarctic province ought to look like. Every base a sustainable fortress, chained together into a net of iron which neither man nor the elements could shatter. Pujato looked at his watch, shaking his head. A delivery of military supplies was meant to arrive earlier today.\n\nAnd to think with the institute preparing for Operación 90, some lunatics genuinely considered diverting resources for a distant scuffle in the Middle East.

As they spent their day in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Christopher realized how important it was to hold back the Turkish advance. Despite the friction between the Jews and Muslims, they proved to be sufficient custodians of the holiest city on earth. Their land had to be defended before the Turks could have their way with the Levant.\n\n"Corporal!" Private Bartolo, their liaison to the militias entrenched with them, shook the Corporal out of his trance.\n\n"What is it, Private?" The Corporal screamed over the gunfire.\n\n"It's the Zionists down the line! Their Commander Yoav said reinforcements are coming!"

As they approached, Reyes scoffed seeing units that hadn't seen any action at all during the conflict, followed by units that hadn't even been in the Levant. When men in ceremonial uniforms marched past, Reyes spotted their bayonets, and instinctively moved to touch his eyepatch with fingers that no longer existed.\n\nAs the men armed with bayonets marched by, the rhythmic marching faded to gunfire as Reyes was dragged back to that day in the foxhole. The frantic gunfire, the panic in his comrade's eyes as they were gutted by Turkish bayonets, followed by the sound of marching. For hours men marched right past his foxhole while blood flowed from his eye and hand.

"We'd hoped to meet you on the far side of the Rift," said Goetz, "but the blizzard pinned us down until you reached us."\n\n"It wasn't this hard crossing the Rift when we were establishing Sobral Base," Giró told Leal.\n\n"We didn't run into a snowstorm last time," chimed Goetz.\n\n"We made it," said Leal, "That's what matters. Now on to our next objective: the Santa Fe Mountain Range, after we rest at Sobral of course. I believe you have a date with some rocks, Lieutenant."\n\nGoetz laughed, "The men are excited to be the first humans to set foot in those mountains."\n\n"As they should be. Make no mistake, your role in the expedition is every bit as vital as putting our flag at the pole.

"That's to be expected. The ice is very mobile in the Rift."\n\n"So the choice we have now," Carrion continued, "is to backtrack along the edge of the Rift, to the area we have charted..."\n\n"Or blaze a new, possibly shorter trail, through the uncharted area, mapping it as we go," Moreno finished. "Which, I might add, would be a benefit to the claim, further solidifying our hold on the interior. Personally, I'm all for it."\n\n"I have reservations," said Carrion.

His confidence radiated to every member of the expedition, compelling them to push just a bit further, dig a little bit deeper, finding reserves of energy and passion they never knew they possessed.\n\nThe volunteers of Operación 90 began to see Antarctica through Pujato's eyes. They were not meekly moving forward into the all-consuming Antarctic oblivion, but exploring a long-lost corner of Argentina itself.\n\nThis was their homeland, and they were here to bear witness to its splendor.\n\nThe Conqueror of the White Desert stood upon an icy promontory surveilling the landscape. He looked like a figure out of myth, untouched by time.

Without regular maintenance, these vehicles would become nothing but rime-coated epitaphs to man's hubris.\n\nThe Operación, of course, had been planned with this fact in mind. The entire expedition was structured around a core of capable mechanics who could be called upon at any moment to ensure the assault team stayed on the move.\n\nPassing over the Great Rift had been hard on the snowcats. When they reached Sobral, they'd need several days of serious repairs, aided by that base's complement of servicemen. Until then, the burden was on Ceppi's boys to make do with what they had.\n\nFirst Sergeant Carlos Guido Bulacio walked around his snowcat once, looking for any obvious marks of damage. The vehicle had simply shuddered to a halt. His bet was the engine was deprived of fuel, but he wanted to rule out damage to the undercarriage as a result of the nasty sastrugi they passed. Finding nothing on the exterior, he popped the hood.\n\nThere was no damage to the engine either, although he did spot some superficial corrosion as a result of the snowcat's extended use on the coast. Nothing that would put the snowcat out of commission.\n\nHe reached deep into the engine assembly, fumbling for the fuel line. "Yeah," he shouted to Ceppi. "I feel it. There's ice in the fuel li-fuck!" He yanked his hand back out, droplets of blood pouring onto the engine. He'd caught his palm on one of those God damned rusted segments.

They were the only two riding up front, and had total privacy. There, Leal told his second-in-command all that had occurred on Adelaide Island, the doctoring of the battlefield, and the ensuing rescue of the Rosario and San Martín's crews by Pujato. When he was finished, Giró sat with his jaw hanging open, "So... it's war?" he asked.\n\n"The Chileans aren't idiots. Massera's ruse won't fool them for long. But... without hard evidence, it would be difficult for them to justify any action against us. I've no doubt that the Navy will give them another reason soon enough. Massera can't let his failure stand. He'll seek our removal from the administration, and the navy can run things as they see fit."\n\n"What's our plan?" asked Giró, "How do we beat Massera?"\n\n"Planting our flag at the pole will protect us in the short term from any political maneuvering back home that could result in our dismissal. The second step, which is already underway, is to create an airbase on Marambio Island to provide us with a supply line independent of the navy," Leal paused to maneuverer around a sastrugi. "The third step is upon our return. We will build a coalition of like-minded individuals, within the naval bases, and hell, even the crews of the ships themselves.

The dogs and men needed sleep. All of this contrived to make the last few hundred meters a hellish slog.\n\nThe base was difficult to make out, even at such a short distance.\n\nThe blizzards that had blown through since its construction had buried it further in the snow, till only the roof, front door, motor pool and signpost remained visible.\n\nSquinting against the cutting wind, Colonel Leal made out a solitary figure standing before the base, waving.\n\nLeal began to laugh, and stuck his arm out the window of his snowcat, waving back. "Come on, step on the gas!" shouted Giró over the radio, "I know where Perez stashed his liquor!"\n\nThe snowcats surged forward, every man in the column eager to be the first to reach the base.

The facilities were well-maintained, supplies were meticulously managed, and the sleeping accommodations warm. The men would find rest, here.\n\nFollowing a short, hearty meal of beef stew and hard tack, the men shared an optimistic, yet subdued toast to the dream of an Argentine flag at the bottom of the world. Then, they put Argentine heads to pillows and slept like the dead.\n\nThe one exception to all this was Colonel Leal, who tossed and turned in his bed. It was a leader's lot, to constantly worry about the future.\n\nHe thought of the next stage of their journey with trepidation. Their equipment had already been through a lot, and they'd only traveled a few days. What would weeks do to the expedition? And what came after? They'd pinned all their hopes and dreams on this one mission, but would it have the effect they intended? Men like Massera didn't step aside for symbols, they trampled them, or twisted them to their own ends.\n\nCould megalomaniacs be disarmed peacefully, or did force always have to be met with force?\n\nLeal had none of these answers, and so he stared at the roof of Sobral and listened to the wind."

A few wrong choices, and no one would get to go home.\n\nThis can't be for nothing, Leal thought."

Sastrugi, razor-sharp, as far as the eye could see in either direction.\n\n"Fuck," Goetz muttered. He picked up his radio. "Colonel, stop the convoy. We have a serious problem.\n\nA few minutes later, Leal arrived from the column and surveyed the situation. "Dammit..." He looked through his binoculars, studying the sastrugi for several minutes. "We can't drive through that. The snowcats will be ripped to shreds."\n\n"Maybe we can," Giró said. "The sastrugi overlap, and I can see gaps in them. If we can find a section that doesn't have sharp edges facing us, we might be able to slip through these ridges."\n\n"I hope so. This structure's massive. I don't like the idea of trying to go around. That could take days, and that's time we can't afford to lose." Leal made a decision. "Giró, take one dog team. Goetz, take yours. You'll each scout in opposite directions, radioing in regularly. Hopefully, one of you can find a way through."\n\nShortly thereafter, the snowcats entered the sastrugi fields, following a carefully-laid series of markers.\n\nEven knowing there was a safe path, the driving was no less dangerous. It took hours to make it to the other side."

Scientific discovery; the hope of Argentine Antarctica. I don't doubt that you'll find things that change our understanding of this place."\n\n"I'm just sorry I won't get to see you make history," said Goetz with a smile.\n\nLeal chuckled, "I could say the same about you. A flag is one thing, but making a discovery that redefines our understanding of life, and the history of this planet, will bring honor to you and Argentina," He offered his hand, "Good luck, stay warm, and stay safe."\n\nAs the two groups exchanged farewells, Leal pulled Goetz close and whispered in his ear. "Be careful. There are those who would be happy to see this Operación fail. Keep your wits about you, and your eyes open for signs of human activity."\n\nGoetz was surprised, but nodded, "They won't get the drop on us, sir. We'll shoot first and ask questions later."\n\n"Good." When all was said and done, the two groups mounted up and peeled off in different directions: the Assault Group for the South Pole, and Patrol 82 for the Santa Fe Range, an undiscovered country."

A mountain range like the Santa Fe was an archive of the past, the strata layered like the pages of an immense book that told the story of eons.\n\nThis story, in this mountain range, had never been read. Hopefully, Patrol 82 could bring back a few chapters for the scientists back home.\n\nThe air was thinner, here. Like the rest of Operación 90, Goetz's group had been heading steadily uphill ever since leaving Belgrano. The effect was most pronounced closer to the range.\n\nNo one was riding the dog sleds at the moment; the men ran alongside the sleds to keep the dogs focused. But neither was anyone in a hurry. So it was that Patrol 82 approached the gates of the Santa Fe Range at a deliberate pace.\n\nDeep shadows stretched between the peaks. Goetz felt a brief moment of animal fear looking into them. They seemed too dark, too ominous. His body rebelled at passing into them.\n\nThis is a place of secrets, he thought.\n\nOur past is written all around us.\n\nOur future too, maybe."

Lieutenant Goetz stood watch, scanning the range with his binoculars for signs of life.\n\nFirst Sergeant Ramon Villar sat next to him, making cartographic notes of the terrain and the path they'd taken into the mountains.\n\nOne of their objectives was to chart the range; the more Argentine Antarctica mapped its territories, especially the interior, the stronger their claim became.\n\nMeanwhile, First Corporals Marcelo Enoch Alvarez and Leonardo Isabel Guzman set about taking samples of the oldest rock on the mountain side, fulfilling the AAI's goal of gathering scientific knowledge.\n\nThe upper strata was an Antarctic geologist's dream, containing Early Cambrian deposits of ash flow tuff-lahar, greywacke-argillite-conglomerate, black shales, marble,and quartzite-argillite. Until this very moment, the only forces that had affected these rocks had been wind, snow, and the slow, inexorable upheaval of tectonic plates.\n\nPausing to examine some of the samples, Goetz had a profound moment of introspection. Whatever Operación 90 achieved, whatever the fate of Argentine Antarctica, whatever surprises this century might hold, it was all simply a brief moment in the planet's history. We were born of this Earth, Goetz thought, and eventually, regardless of who wins this struggle for Antarctica, we'll return to the Earth.

One was always in shadow in the range, the looming peaks turning the valleys into twisting tapestries of light and dark.\n\nAnything could be hiding behind the next rock, the next embankment.\n\nIt was a good place for an ambush.\n\nEven though the sun never set fully in this part of Antarctica during summer, Goetz felt like he was seeing daylight for the first time in days as his team exited the range.\n\nThe team had extracted perfect samples from a broad range of geologic eras, encompassing half a billion years of the planet's history, yet even that was barely an eighth of Earth's total lifespan.\n\nThere was still so much left to explore, so much to learn, but Patrol 82 had added substantially to the combined scientific knowledge of mankind.\n\nNot to mention they were the first human beings to set foot in the Santa Fe Range, accurately mapping it, and planting an Argentine Flag in the shadow of its peaks.\n\nNow all we have to do is get back to Sobral alive, Goetz thought. He looked back one last time at the receding mountains. He still couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched."

All soldiers learned to listen to that feeling when they got it. He couldn't wait to get out on the open desert where he could see for miles. Patrol 82 made good time to the end of the range. They were within a kilometer of the foothills when ten men armed with assault rifles rose from the rocky outcroppings and surrounded them. "Freeze!" their leader called, speaking perfect Spanish with a slight inflection, "Put your weapons on the ground and keep your hands in the air!" The dogs went wild, yelping, straining at the leads, trying to defend their masters. "You!" The leader pointed at Guzman, "Get those dogs under control!" Villar, Alvarez, and Guzman looked to Goetz for orders. "Do exactly as they say," said Goetz, clearly, so their ambushers could hear. Patrol 82 surrendered their weapons, and Guzman calmed the dogs down. Nine of the other soldiers closed in. "We're just a scientific expedition," said Goetz, "We're Argentinian."\n\nThe leader lowered his weapon, "Lucky for you, we already knew that. If you weren't an exploratory mission, this would be a very different conversation," The leader looked to his men and nodded. They removed the geological samples and newly-drawn maps, and took down the Argentinian flag. Goetz and his men could only glare in response. "Now go back the way you came." Goetz and his men collected the dogs and departed the Santa Fe Range empty handed. Not only had the samples and maps been taken, but Patrol 82 hadn't even been the first to set foot in the Santa Fe range. "That man had an accent," said Goetz, when they were out of earshot, "I think he grew up in a Spanish-speaking family... but in an English-speaking country.""

"Stop, Colonel, stop!" Giró said, "Your sled's overturned!"\n\nLeal sighed, "Copy," He brought the snowcat to a complete stop and dismounted into the punishing wind.\n\nThe sleds were semi-destroyed, and the skis no longer cut the snow as effectively. Walking behind his snowcat, Leal saw that his sled was not simply overturned, but one of the runners had snapped off. They'd have to unload the sled, redistribute the weight among the convoy, and fix it on the move.\n\nGiró came running up the convoy to Leal. "Oh shit," he said, "We can't afford to keep losing sleds at this rate."\n\n"I know," Leal shouted over the wind. He looked at his snowcat, "Giró, redistribute the supplies from this sled, quickly as you can."\n\n"Yes, sir. I also have a suggestion: one of the snowcats is really banged up.

It was far too dangerous to try and move through it, so Leal gambled on weathering the storm.\n\nThey had to stop anyway; their vehicles had been eviscerated by the harsh traversal of Antarctica. After the tents were erected, Leal helped set up an impromptu repair station where they could weld the supply sled skis back on, along with performing the sundry maintenance tasks associated with snowcats.\n\nOnce the camp was set up and doing its best, Leal retired to his tent to write in the expedition log, "Our supply sleds are failing us at an ever-accelerating rate," he wrote, "We are detained, wasting precious time, consuming rations and fuel that we have so measured."\n\nWhat Leal didn't commit to the journal was his serious reservations about their chances. The men's morale was at an all time low, and if vehicles kept breaking, the team would be walking to the pole and back, and he well knew how that had worked out for Scott.\n\nHe would have to take stock of things again once the blizzard had cleared.\n\nThen, as an afterthought, he recorded one more item in the journal."

Ernest Shackleton had repeatedly faced disaster and still survived. Humans had a way of defying the odds.\n\nA couple of men occasionally went out to check on the dogs, who were almost certainly doing better than their human counterparts.\n\nA single dog team had stayed with the South Pole Assault Group after Patrol 82 had left.

He strode a few paces from the snowcat, and waved at the column. The men filed out and started cheering and hugging each other. A few wept openly. Leal's legs shook, and he knelt in the snow. Years of work, sacrifice, and struggle. With trembling hands, he reached into his coat and took out the photograph of his team, snapped in that dank little bar in Ushuaia a year ago.

He heard their bones creak as they shifted in their sleeping bags.\n\nA sound like a gunshot caused his eyes to slam open. He saw sunlight rippling across the ceiling, felt warm softness all around him.\n\nThinking to himself, Leal realized the gunshot was actually a champagne cork popping off. He sat up, running his hands over the duvet on his bed. Leal had a surreal feeling, like his dream was somehow more real than this hotel room.\n\nThe South Pole Assault Group and Patrol 82 had quickly flown to Matienzo Joint Base and caught a flight to Ministro Pistarini International Airport, in Buenos Aires.\n\nFrom there, they'd been chauffeured to one of the city's most luxurious hotels, the Alvear Palace.

The conquest of the island should've precipitated a war that Massera would have decisively won. The glory should be his, and his alone.\n\nAnd now here he was, reading about another man's success. The papers raved of their heroism and bravery. What heroism? What bravery? These men fled into the interior, shirking their responsibilities as soldiers, hiding behind a flag and calling it achievement, an assertion of Argentine sovereignty.\n\nMassera resolved to show them what it truly meant to assert sovereignty: it could only be done atop a mountain of corpses. And if Massera had to personally build that mountain, he would; he'd build it body by body, high enough to reach the office of the presidency."

Leal wondered if the newspapers had already reached the Captain, and what he would think, and more importantly, do.\n\nA reckoning was fast approaching, and Leal knew he'd need every ounce of political capital he'd built on the way to the pole, and every loyal friend he had. There would be a battle for the soul of Argentine Antarctica, and Leal would stop at nothing to excise Massera and all his machinations from the soil of that land.\n\nGiró shook Leal's shoulder as they turned another corner. "Hey, the President's on that stage," he said, nodding to the end of the street, "Any idea what you'll say?"\n\n"I have a few ideas," said Leal, smirking.

The expedition's grueling, marching beat restarted once again. At least until the next snowcat needed refueling.\n\nLeal emptied another jerry can.

The Assault Group would have to march the rest of the way, using man-hauling yokes to drag their supplies behind them. Every necessity of life in this wasteland would have to be pulled behind them, one kilometer after another, day after day.\n\nOperación 90 had not been designed around this eventuality.

"We can last a couple of days without food before our energy flags too much for us to move. When that happens, we'll have to make some difficult choices."\n\nGiró took his meaning, his eyes wandering to the pack of gallant huskies that had guided them through one trial after another in this godforsaken land. It would be hard on all of them, to do what must be done.\n\nAfter all, hadn't Amundsen butchered his dogs for food?\n\n"And after that?"
