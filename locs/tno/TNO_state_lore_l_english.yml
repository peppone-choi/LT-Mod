 # Notes

 # [GetSLName] is a scripted loc used to get custom names, for example, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macaw's name is called "The Three Pearls" instead of the usual state name it's parented in, located in TNO_state_lore_misc_scripted_localisation.txt

 # INITIALS are preferably airport codes: for example LAX as Los Angeles, but not when it doesn't make sense, i.e. OPO as Porto. I chose to use POR in that case.

 state_lore_initials.1: " GER "
 state_lore_name.1: "Germania"
 state_lore_desc.1: "Welthauptstadt-Germania may look like the shining fruit of the Führer's labor, but its roots run deep, as does the rot infecting it.\n\nHundreds of meters below Speer's elegantly designed promenades and Hitler's megalomaniacal symbols of his will, great concrete and steel superstructures groan under the weight of the Welthauptstadt, while pumps run round the clock to keep the swamps of Old Berlin from swallowing the Führer's vision.\n\nThe tremendous, and classified, cost of reshaping Berlin far exceeded even the plunder of a dozen nations, and outside the whispering grand halls of the city centre, the Berliners of old still live like before Germania's rise, or in cheap apartment blocks for the unemployed masses."

 state_lore_initials.2: " TYO "
 state_lore_name.2: "Tōkyō"
 state_lore_desc.2: "Beneath the facade of the mighty "eastern capital" of the Empire of Japan, behind the curtains of the Imperial Palace and its bustling wards, and under the blanket of the city's lively aura lies great sorrow and corruption.\n\nIn military headquarters, IJA Generals and IJN Admirals constantly try their earnest to foil the plans of the other as they scheme their own, and those willing to cooperate plan the next operation to put down freedom fighters somewhere in the Sphere.\n\nIn the halls of the national diet, politicians bicker of their own 'correct' way of running the nation and the Empire, seemingly without end. Not to mention the corruption that runs deep within the veins of every politician, the one that replaces their will to shape a better future for Japan with their want of money.\n\nPerhaps, it is best to keep these facts out of mind and enjoy the great sights of this bastion of Japanese glory."

 state_lore_initials.3: " YOK "
 state_lore_name.3: "Yokohama"
 state_lore_desc.3: "There exists few twin cities around the world, most cities differ in one way or another with their neighboring cities, but such is not the case with Yokohama and Tōkyō.\n\nAt face value, these two cities can be seen as carbon copies of each other. Tōkyō and Yokohama are the largest and second largest cities respectively in terms of population size, they are both economically vital to the Japanese Empire, and they are both large port cities with hundreds of ships dropping anchor there each day.\n\nThe city's prominence as a port city can be traced back from near the end of the Edo period, and it is where Commodore Perry first landed and forced in the modern age.\n\nToday, along with civilian ships, Yokohama is a major naval base for IJN fleets, enforcing the will of the Empire around the home islands as well as a base of operations for naval movements across the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Pacific Ocean."

 state_lore_initials.4: " LAX "
 state_lore_name.4: "Los Angeles"
 state_lore_desc.4: "The largest city on the west coast. The third largest city in the country. The home of America's, and arguably the world's, entertainment industry.\n\nThe story of Los Angeles is full of controversy, but no one can say it isn't interesting. Originally a small coastal town, LA began to grow rapidly towards the end of the nineteenth century, continuing unabated through World War 2 and even the 1950s following the Japanese seizure of the port.\n\nAs the home of Hollywood, LA has earned a reputation as a land of glitz and glamor, though the diverse and often impoverished neighborhoods of the growing city are on the front lines of America's civil rights movement."

 state_lore_desc.5: "At the height of World War 2, the port of Los Angeles employed almost 100,000 Americans. These days only a small fraction of that number turn up for work every day, and a different flag flies over the warships that fill the harbor.\n\nAs one of the two Japanese concessions bordering the American mainland, the port of LA is a constant hotspot of world tension. Japanese and US soldiers watch each other from behind checkpoints, and both the sailors of the IJN and the residents of LA hope their uncomfortable proximity never escalates to hostility.\n\nWhile some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"

 state_lore_initials.6: " SFO "
 state_lore_name.6: "San Francisco"
 state_lore_desc.6: "Following the gold rush of 1848 San Francisco became the largest city on the west coast of North America. Though it has since been surpassed in size by the likes of Los Angeles and San Diego, it retains its importance as a center of American finance and cultural development.\n\nThe rolling hills and rail-lined streets of San Francisco have long been a home to America's more eccentric elements and the budding counterculture, most recently manifesting as the beat movement of the 1950s, though many suspect this is only a hint of what is soon to come for the city by the bay."

 state_lore_desc.7: "Much like its European namesake, the Paris of the West is a city divided. Though most of the city remains in the USA, the port facilities have been held by Japan since 1945. One of the farthest flung territories of the Japanese Empire, the port of San Francisco is a major asset to the sphere.\n\nThe tiny sliver of Japanese territory, along with its southern counterpart in Los Angeles, are constant sources of tension between two of the world's superpowers, but as long as the Japanese retain their ability to immediately threaten the entire west coast, they're happy to pay that price.\n\nWhile some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"

 state_lore_initials.8: " NYC "
 state_lore_name.8: "New York City"
 state_lore_desc.8: "The very definition of a city that never sleeps, New York City is the fruit of the labor of generations of hardworking individuals, with an astounding amount of commerce passing through it each and every day.\n\nFirst settled by the Dutch in 1624 as New Amsterdam, it changed hands over the centuries and now stands as a proud bastion of American freedoms, exemplified by the Statue of Liberty in its harbor. Countless different cultures have taken root in the city, long a relative safe haven for oppressed peoples from all over the world from tyranny in their distant homelands.\n\nEqually attractive as the open mindedness of the city, however, are its open markets, being one of the premier centers of international business and finance as well as the greatest display of American economic might. There's always something to do in New York for any person willing to pay the right price."

 state_lore_initials.9: " D.C. "
 state_lore_name.9: "Washington D.C."
 state_lore_desc.9: "To describe Washington, D.C. as just a city would be entirely inappropriate. D.C. is more than a collection of buildings or roads, it is more than the amalgamation of human will, forced together into an urban sprawl that defines D.C.\n\nNo, what defines the District of Columbia best is the building on the hill- the home of freedom and security, in a world where such a commodity is hard to come by. Such freedom is not fought over for the denizens of this city, but fought with, in the halls of Congress, where issues of undeniable importance are fought over and where the future of the nation as a whole is decided.\n\nWith the stirring winds of democracy blowing strong, and the future uncertain as ever, these freedoms of democracy are more than something to ensure freedom, but something to hold on to in these turbulent times. May they protect us forevermore."

 state_lore_initials.10: " ROM "
 state_lore_name.10: "Rome"
 state_lore_desc.10: "Rome, the Eternal City, stands as the jewel of the Mediterranean and the capital of the Italian Empire. Founded millennia ago by Romulus on the banks of the Tiber, few cities- if any- can claim such an expansive history. Indeed, there's not an inch of the city that isn't rich with the legacy of the Roman Empire, the pride of Italian history.\n\nDespite the invasions, plagues, and misfortunes that have fallen on the city before, Rome has always emerged from the rubble, ready to rebuild- and, in doing so, has cemented its place as the center of Italy. It is here where the King, the Pope, and the Duce stay, and it is here that the Italian government sits, along with artists, culinary geniuses, and romantics from across the world.\n\nMake no mistake- Rome has survived thousands of years before, and- barring the apocalypse- it will survive thousands of years more."

 state_lore_initials.11: " MAD "
 state_lore_name.11: "Madrid"
 state_lore_desc.11: "Previously devastated by over two years under siege during the Spanish Civil War, Madrid has recovered to become the largest and wealthiest city in Iberia.\n\nThe unique and varied designs of Madrid's "Gran Vía" is admired by architects and artists the world over. Most of the country's brightest minds attend university here, nearly all Iberian films are produced here, and most of Iberia's largest companies are headquartered here.\n\nAs Iberians increasingly choose to leave the countryside for the city, tens of thousands move to Madrid every year, this rapid expansion has made Madrid into one of the single largest cities in Europe--and there are no signs that this growth is slowing down."

 state_lore_initials.12: " HAM "
 state_lore_name.12: "Hamburg"
 state_lore_desc.12: "At the mouth of the Elbe lies the Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the third largest city in Germany behind only Vienna and Germania itself. The birthplace of the Hanseatic league, since medieval times Hamburg has been the preeminent naval port connecting Germany to the rest of the world. In the post-war order, her stature only becomes more significant.\n\nBut little is stable in Hamburg. A hotbed of liberal agitation since the 19th century, Hamburg now finds itself torn between the reformists, the conservatives, and behind closed doors, even anti-fascist revolutionaries.\n\nBut for the subversives captured by the Gestapo, a horrible fate lies just a few miles upstream. There sits Neuengamme, the largest concentration camp in Germany proper, a symbol of Nazi tyranny in the eyes of nearly the entire world."

 state_lore_initials.13: " FRA "
 state_lore_name.13: "Frankfurt am Main"
 state_lore_desc.13: "Lying directly in the center of Central Europe's most densely populated and economically productive region, Frankfurt am Main is in many senses an enormous monument to German industry. Every year, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all the Reich make Frankfurt their home.\n\nBefore Hitler's rise to power, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all Europe would seek to make Frankfurt their home. Once the home of Germany's largest Jewish community, widely regarded as the birthplace of German liberalism, and recognized as a center of the European labor movement, Frankfurt has now stagnated for decades, as skill and ingenuity are abandoned for the convenience of slave labor.\n\nNevertheless, Frankfurt remains one of Germany's largest cities, and serves as the main railway junction between the Rhineland and the rest of the country."

 state_lore_initials.14: " MUC "
 state_lore_name.14: "München"
 state_lore_desc.14: "München, also known as Munich in English, has played a pivotal role in German history for centuries. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria, hosting thinkers and creators from Max Planck to Richard Wagner. But it took on a far greater significance in the last half-century: the cradle of the Nazi Party.\n\nFollowing the German defeat in the First World War, München was a chaotic place, as two competing revolutionary socialist governments clashed with the Freikorps in the streets. It was in this environment where a small group of nationalist ideologues and disgruntled veterans coalesced to form the German Workers' Party.\n\nOne of its members, an Austrian-born veteran named Adolf Hitler, would climb the ranks and become its leader, transforming it into the National Socialist German Workers' Party. It was in the beer halls of München that Hitler built his first power base, and launched his failed putsch in 1923. It was where the Nazi Party established their national headquarters. And it was where Hitler convinced the British and French to cede him Czechoslovakia to secure a peace he had no intent of keeping. München remains a bastion of Nazism today, and he who is most influential in it has the key to the Nazi heartland."

 state_lore_initials.15: " BIO "
 state_lore_name.15: "Bilbao"
 state_lore_desc.15: "Sitting beside Iberia's most fertile estuary, atop a mountain of iron ore, Bilbao was always destined to become one of the great industrial cities of Iberia. But Bilbao is also the cultural capital of the Basque people, who have lived in Iberia for centuries and likely millennia, longer than the Latins.\n\nGradually stripped of their autonomy, and their traditional culture challenged by Spaniard encroachment, much of the city's youth views 'Iberian unity' as a polite euphemism for repression. Bilbao will no doubt be the site of many political battles in coming years."

 state_lore_initials.16: " BCN "
 state_lore_name.16: "Barcelona"
 state_lore_desc.16: "The head and heart of Catalonia was the first of Iberia's cities to fully industrialize, but recent decades have brought immense hardship to the people of Iberia's largest Mediterranean city.\n\nFor two and a half years during the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona was the capital of an abortive anarchist revolution. In a city further destabilized by repressive policies targeting the Catalan people, and further jeopardized by economic stagnation, the memory of that revolution lives on.\n\nBarcelona has suffered from steady economic decline in recent decades. Should the situation fail to improve, already widespread anti-government and separatist sentiments may become overwhelming."

 state_lore_initials.17: " POR "
 state_lore_name.17: "Porto"
 state_lore_desc.17: "Portugal's second largest city was the birthplace of the medieval Portuguese Kingdom, as well as the 1926 revolution which began Salazar's rise to power.\n\nThough the exceptionally fast growth of Lisbon has reduced the relative importance of Porto it remains the largest manufacturing hub in the whole country. The population of Porto is somewhat more conservative than the rest of Portugal, and support for Iberian Unity is much higher than in Lisbon."

 state_lore_initials.18: " LIS "
 state_lore_name.18: "Lisboa"
 state_lore_desc.18: "Once the Shining Jewel of all the World's Desire, Lisboa, forged by Ulysses has suffered much over the years. Yet, the 20th century has pumped fresh blood into the aging collosus. Thanks to the extermination of their Atlantic rivals by Hitler's craven ambition, Lisboa reemerged as the most paramount port city in Western Europe, serving as a beacon for commerce and migration to any Eastward Travellers from the Americas. With the entry to the Tejo guarded by Christ on one side and the New Colossus on the other, Lisboa is without question the city that bears the ripest fruit from the so-called "Iberian Project".\n\nDespite this untold prosperity, its citizens do not find themselves wholly supportive of the regime that governs them. Torn between the mays of Charybdis - Caetano's Reformist influence on the city from his position of Dean of the University of Lisbon - and the many heads of Scylla - Borges' Conservative compadres in the City Council - the ideals of Liberalism and Socialism call Lisboa home. From the dock workers to the university students, the city would become a beacon for Reformist thought, at least outside its government. Despite itself, Lisboa still stands tall as a bastion of concord in the barbarity that is Europe in the 20th century, even if some inside it would prefer for it not to be the case. However, as for what the future holds? Only Christ understands. And he is content to watch over the city in stony silence."

 state_lore_initials.19: " SVL "
 state_lore_name.19: "Sevilla"
 state_lore_desc.19: "The heart of the old Spanish empire, Sevilla was one of the largest, wealthiest, and most magnificent cities in early-modern Europe. These days, it finds itself being overtaken by other cities, playing second fiddle to Rome, Hamburg, and even Lisbon in terms of trade and economic activity, with its fortunes being further hampered by heavy flooding and unusually heavy rain that has even once led to the city being marked as a disaster zone.\n\nHowever, with a growing industrial sector and its population appearing to be on the rise more and more each year, Sevilla seems ready to take its place as one of the most prosperous cities of Iberia soon. Concerning to some and inspirational to others, Sevilla is also one of Iberia's most prominent centers of underground liberal political organization in the country, with rumors of a thriving hotbed of illegal trade unionism operating within the city."

 state_lore_desc.21: "France has been a thalassocratic power for much of its history, owning most notably to its numerous overseas possessions, but also to its large coast bordering the Atlantic Ocean: Brest, standing at the westernmost point of the Breton peninsula, is one of France's proudest outposts, and sternly glares at the sea, its numerous lighthouses having lit the paths of many a lost sailor.\n\nHowever, whispers abound in Breizh, as the Quiberon peninsula has recently gone silent. Rumors of disgruntled nationalists finally deciding to act are growing louder and louder, and soon darkness may manage to do what the ocean never could: engulf Brest, and Brittany as a whole, once and for all."

Nowadays, Poitiers finds itself in an interesting position, halfway between Paris and Bordeaux. The central-western town of France is once again a strategic location for the three divided powers seeking to rule their fraction of Western Europe."

 state_lore_desc.23: "The Moon's Harbor, as it is often called, is one of France's biggest and populous cities, and one that was left relatively unscathed by the multiple turmoils France had to endure. Renowned the world over for its tasteful wine, with its historical monuments being a source of pride, Bordeaux truly stands today as one of the country's most important cities.\n\nBordeaux being mostly spared from hardship came from no miracle, however. Mayor Adrien Marquet's enthusiastic collaboration, along with the founding of pro-PPF college Sciences Po Bordeaux in the late 40s, ensured that the city would be viewed as a bastion of the Révolution Nationale, free from the corrupting influences of reformism and bolshevism. How much more can the Harbor last, however, before the flood gates forcibly open?"

 state_lore_desc.24: "Founded in 600 BCE as one of the oldest cities in Europe, Marseille has stood tall from its ancient Greek origins to its contemporary French authority.\n\nDevastating civil wars, barbarians, sieges, plagues, revolutions, and world wars have all conspired to destroy the ancient city, and World War II nearly cast the city into the inescapable fire, but its people have survived and thrived throughout.\n\nThe city saw Rouget de Lisle write the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The old city stands today as one of the largest cities in France; may God preserve Marseille for many more centuries."

Ask a Parisian about Paris in 1919, and he might have told you of it as the center of the world. Ask a Parisian about Paris today, and you will get a canvas of broken dreams and lost glory, a twinge of sadness in his eyes, for the years have not been kind to the Ville-Lumière.\n\nOnce a capital of all things cultured, Paris today stands as a shadow of its former self. The Haussmannian buildings frown at the daily sight of German soldiers, as Parisians try their best to live their lives in spite of all the hardships they have to endure. And yet, they live on, for better or for worse; for there is no alternative but to give in to despair, as the denizens of France know all too well."

The city demonstrates an interesting blend of some French and mostly German culture, having been a previous territory of the Holy Roman Empire and Revolutionary France.\n\nToday, the Swiss capital rejoices in its isolated independence. The city hosted socialist Internationals during World War I and saw frequent mediation and espionage between the Allied and Axis powers during World War II.

It's a boogeyman for kids and adults alike, something like an asteroid falling towards France or a nuclear war wiping out humanity, the screaming of sirens as a bad storm hits, the idea of their borders coming any closer terrifies any man, woman, or child.\n\nAll of this doom and gloom there is a dichotomy for the heirs of the ancient Roman settlement of Divio.

Nearly thousand years and many rulers later - the city was controlled by the Burgundians, Spanish, the Austrians, the French, and an independent Belgian kingdom - Brussels is once again under the thumb of Germans ruling from Burgundy. The Nazis made Brussels the capital of a Belgian Reichskommissariat when they invaded, and it remained in place for over a decade. After the West Russian War, the territory was handed over to Heinrich Himmler, for him to reshape into the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. Despite the disdain of the city's citizens, as well as the Flemish and Walloon SS divisions, Himmler is hellbent on restoring mythical German greatness to the city and all others under his rule."

It was established by Viking raiders in the 10th century, and became the first Norman foothold on the island in 1171. It spent the following 750 years as the center of English, and later British, rule in Ireland, until Irish independence was achieved in 1921.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland selected the city as their capital, the greatest gem in the Emerald Isle's crown.

It grew even further in the 19th century and became the heart of Irish industry, though its swelling population led to rising tensions between Catholic and Protestant residents. However, it was still a town dominated by pro-British Unionists, and became the capital of British North Ireland following the south's independence.\n\nThat all changed in the 1940s, when the Germans swept into Britain and the Republic took over the whole island.

Elsewhere, you may find members of the British Free Corps, unchecked as they are, beating someone in a back alley, or perhaps on a bold day, the town square, within an inch of their life, for no reason at all.\n\nBut it is in the spirit, the essence, the soul, of this town, that the change is most notable.

It felt like that for a century and a half after that, too - the Industrial Revolution and all its innovation, the Underground, the tea shops and new landmarks, and the fact that London was the financial centre of the world and of an Empire on which the Sun never set.\n\nThe Blitz came, and the people of London suffered terribly; more than thirty-thousand were slain, large tracts of housing were ruined, people fled in droves to the countryside and beyond. Had that been all that happened, London would have bounced back - but the Hitlerites had more in store for the prime city of Britain.\n\nThe capital of the United Kingdom fell to Germany after a long and bloody siege by Wehrmacht forces. Fighting in the outer boroughs had an intensity not seen since that of the Eastern Front. The city centre, however, was largely spared after Germany accepted its surrender.

Fears that the city would follow Hatay and be annexed by Ankara were elided with Syria becoming an allied 'sister republic', but this did little to reverse the fortunes of the city.\n\nToday Aleppo is a city of entropy. Effectively reduced to be a border town, its commercial and industrial base is syphoned north to fuel Anatolia's development.

In 1917, Tsaritsyn fell under Soviet control, but the Whites fought hard to regain control over it for three years. Five years after the Whites were defeated, the city was named Stalingrad for Iosef Stalin, who played a key role in the battle; it was known by this name until Field Marshal Paulus conquered the city during the Second World War.\n\nNowadays, Paulusburg is the second centre of the Moskowien administration after Moskau.

This is Antofagasta, a city that men have fought and died for.\n\nAntofagasta in its modern role serves as the center of the sizable Chilean mining industry, and it has always been a desired jewel of the Andean nations. Originally a Bolivian nitrate mining settlement, the nascent "La Chimba" was the center of a massive Chilean immigration wave in the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\nA lucrative mining town with a large ethnic minority on an international border was, unsurprisingly, a center of conflict. Growing tension between Chile and Bolivia over territorial disputes and a Bolivian tax on Chilean nitrate mining companies would culminate in the 4 year long War of the Pacific. Chile, despite the odds, defeated the combined Bolivian and Peruvian armies over the course of the war, ultimately gaining the resource-rich Bolivian coastline, including the city of Antofagasta.\n\nNow, Antofagasta is the center of one of the world's largest nitrate and copper mining operations, and modern innovations in the field of electrochemistry mean that the mining companies have begun to tap into the region's large lithium reserves.

Many of the city's famed funiculars no longer run; its labyrinthian cobblestone streets are no longer safe to wander.

The Chileans arrived a single day before the French, who themselves were narrowly ahead of the British. Had they arrived any later, the city may have been named Sandy Point or Point de Sable instead of Punta Arenas.\n\nFort Bulnes, over time, outgrew the rocky outcropping on which it was established, and in 1848, it was reestablished on the banks of the nearby river Las Minas as the part-penal colony, part-civilian settlement Punta Arenas. The city's location on the undisputed center of Atlantic-Pacific trade as well as the discovery of gold contributed to the city's massive growth in the late 1800s, and while the opening of the Panama Canal caused the city to fall from its mercantile apoapsis and stagnate, it is still a city of key strategic and cultural importance.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chiang's Kuomintang was one such government. Being the head of operations for the Chinese and American armies in China and South East Asia, Chongqing faced heavy bombing by the Japanese. While much of the population was able to take refuge in air-raid shelters, the city's industry was hit hard by Japanese attacks, and when Japanese troops finally occupied the city during the waning stages of the war, there wasn't much left.\n\nOf course, Chongqing's population wasn't content with a ruined city. Chongqing's position in the Sichuan basin gave it ample resources to rebuild, and together with its large population, Chongqing was able to rebuild faster than most Chinese cities. Of course, to end here would be telling only half of the story.\n\nFar away from Nanjing and the central government, Sichuan has often been difficult for the RGOC to control. Communist guerrillas, Kuomintang hold-outs, and unhappy peasants are in near-constant uprising and make Chongqing's wealth much harder for the central government to exploit. Unlike in other provinces, such as Shanxi, Nanjing is much more unwilling to give the riches of Sichuan to a power-hungry warlord.

Chinese troops abandoned Jinan and were ordered to burn down government buildings, as well as the Japanese consulate. The ensuing power vacuum led to Jinan descending into chaos.

After the capture of Taiyuan in late 1937, the Japanese exploited Taiyuan to its fullest extent. Taiyuan was able to supply the IJA well in its campaigns to root out the Communist base areas in Northern China. Taiyuan saw little growth during this time, as resources and material were shipped out of the mountains of Shanxi and into the war machine of Japan.

While far away from Nanjing and the central government, Xi'an remains a powerhouse in North China."

Becoming the capital of China in 1937, Wuhan became a major target for Japanese aggression in the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the grueling Battle of Wuhan, in which millions of Chinese men fought to defend the city, Japanese forces proved to be superior and captured the region in late 1938. After the war, with the Japanese victorious, Wuhan was left in ruin.\n\nForced to rebuild much of the city, it would take years for Wuhan to recover to its prewar state. In the modern day, Wuhan is one of the only cities in China not plagued with uprising or instability. Wuhan remains one of the most important cities for the Chinese government to hold onto."

In the Xinhai Revolution, Xuzhou was thrown into the thick of fighting with Zhang Xun's army capturing the city soon after the revolution, making it his base of operations. When the Northern Expedition reached Jiangsu, the Kuomintang government fought back and forth with local warlords and Beiyang splitters. Eventually coming under the control of the KMT in late 1927, Xuzhou was looking to be an important city for the government to occupy if they wanted to stay in control of the lands around the Yellow River.\n\nIn 1938, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in full swing, the Japanese army descended on Xuzhou, sending panic through Chinese high command. The defense of Xuzhou was rushed, and while they showed early success in nearby battles, the situation was determined unwinnable and orders for a general retreat were given. Chinese forces breached the dykes holding back the Yellow River to cover their retreat, and the consequential 1938 Yellow River Flood destroyed much of Xuzhou and other nearby settlements.\n\nMore than 20 years after the horrific flood that flattened the city, Xuzhou is once more a jewel of the North China Plain, but to call the wounds of the Second Sino-Japanese War healed would be inaccurate. Struggling under the flatlining of the RGOC's economy, Xuzhou has found it difficult to rebuild above and beyond its pre-war economy."

All the same, it has gracefully adapted to Chilean rule, and serves as the capital of the Arica y Parinacota Region.\n\nBeing the closest port to the landlocked nation of Bolivia, the city also serves as a free port, allowing tariff free goods to flow in and out of the city.

Rebuilding is a long (and perhaps never complete) process, but the swarms of proverbial ants have already built back up the hill.\n\nThe city has often been called the best defended city in the New World due to the extensive series of forts built by the Spanish during the colonial era, and it is perhaps this sense of physical resilience that gives the people of Valdivia their mental resilience.

To say it has historically been a place of poverty would not be telling a complete picture-- the term "poverty" simply does not cut it for the Iquique of yore.\n\nIt was no less than Charles Darwin who described it as a town "very much in want of everyday necessities, such as water and firewood", and it was no less than 2,000 striking saltpetre miners and their families who were massacred in 1907 as part of the Santa María School massacre. This is not to be unfair to modern Iquique; a wave of European immigration in the early 20th century as well as the city being declared one of Chile's two free ports led to immense development of the city. As it stands now, Iquique is a proud city that has overcome its tumultuous history in the noble manor of many of the old saltpetre towns of Northern Chile.\n\nThe Zofri (Zona Franca of Iquique, the free port) is one of the largest in South America; the city hosts museums and universities; there is even rumors of the formation of a professional football club; all the same, despite the idyllic modern Iquique, the brutal and deprived history of the city will never be forgotten.

The city has a long history stretching back to 1550, and by the War of Independence the city was the largest port in New Spain. The city had become a diverse community of Africans, Chinese, and Filipinos working alongside Spanish settlers, but during the course of the war a brutal siege saw the destruction of the port.

Its situation would finally change in the 1940s with the arrival of Miguel Alemán. As President, Alemán saw both the city's historical importance alongside its location along the coast as an opportunity for investment. With a surge of capital flowing into the city, Acapulco saw itself reclaim much of its colonial glory.

It has been the unwilling host to Miguel Hidalgo when he faced execution. It served as the de facto capital of Nueva Vizcaya, the first province of New Spain to be settled. Even the name "Chihuahua" is ancient, far older than the Spanish conquest; it comes from the Nahuatl language, and it fittingly means "between two waters."

Historically, the region has been referred to as "El Gran Tunal", or "The Great Prickly Pear" due to the force with which the native people resisted the Spanish tide, and while the city is far from the days of conquistador and missionary, the people of SLP still hold their heads high with pride in their city.

It rises past the bronze statue of Juan Godoy, the man who discovered Copiapó's deepest silver mine. It rises past the Catedral de Copiapó, where an old priest aches with quiet divinity. It rises past the verdant farmlands, past the water of the Copiapó river.

The metal beast screams, and begins to churn forward. The Copiapó-Caldera Railway - the first railway in all of South America - is open, and Copiapó will never be the same.\n\nA rich mining town, Copiapó is the ideal north Chilean city. It is a center of industry, culture, and government. Its silver and copper veins are deep and plentiful. It is centered on an Indian cemetery (with some remains being no younger than 10,000 years old). The people are happy, kind, and collaborative, and the city is flourishing under a local commerce boom. Originally settled as San Francisco de la Selva de Copiapó (or, Saint Francis of the Jungle of Copiapó), it has always been an oasis in the desert. It has always been the soul of Atacama."

In better times, the Mississippi Queen's neon-white lights and elaborate technicolor Mardi Gras costumes would have provided the beacon of civilization over the steamy Louisiana swamps and decaying plantation houses.\n\nNew Orleans' best days are behind her now. While the Empress walks and talks like a goddess, her courtesans make their final bows. Educated African-Americans are migrating from the South to the sun-baked sands of California and rain-battered Manhattan, while the shining megalopolises of Houston and Miami both enviously eye the throne. The colossal port - that once was its source of power - has been supplanted by other ports, near and far; with the banking industry retreating out of the state to more prosperous shores. Regardless, New Orleans stands tall, her back straight and her eyes to the horizon. While the daggers to her back may be sharp, its inhabitants - whether they be the designer suits in the Downtown Area or the haggard aldermen of the French Quarter - will serve their sovereign dutifully."

The drop in global trade, the protectionism of the Hoover administration, and violent labor strife put the hammer on the city's once-bustling maritime traffic. The city's slow recovery was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, bringing with it both government contracts and renewed prosperity, even as it shattered its nascent Japanese community.\n\nOnce a boomtown for logging and timber, Seattle now thrives beneath the mushrooming of jet-age industry and plentiful government contracts. A fact distinctly exemplified by the newly built Space Needle, an unmistakable sight in the city's skyline. The city's docks, however, remain barren. Once a hotbed of labor strife, isolation from East Asian markets has left Seattle's harbors as shadows of their pre-Depression selves."

Originally nothing more than a tiny settlement comprising an ancient fortress surrounded by a row of impromptu housing, the city would remain as such until the arrival of the fleeing al-Dawasir tribe from the isle of Bahrain. Yet it would only be with the arrival of the Arab-American Oil Company, almost two decades later, that the meagre locality would grow to become one of the Saudi Kingdom's most significant industrial cities as their discovery of petroleum reserves within the city's vicinity brought to it much needed attention from both the government and investors alike. Workers from across Arabia flood into the city, clouds of smoke rise into the city's sky, and streams of oil flow from beneath the ground as the chimes of industry continue to sound within the streets of the bustling city. While Dammam may grow and prosper into one of the Saudi state's most pristine metropolises, its lifeline has also proven to be its main curse, as the often-disgruntled workers of the Oil Industry continue to sow discord within the young city's foundations."

Heavily valued by Spain for its mineral wealth as well as its strategic position, the city was also so thoroughly admired by King Philip II that it was granted the titles of "muy leal" and "muy noble", or very good and very noble respectively.\n\nWith the onset of the War for Mexican Independence, the people of Zacatecas proved themselves among the best and bravest of Mexico's patriotic revolutionaries, joining with Hidalgo's insurrection just days after the mythic Cry of Dolores, where it would succeed in fighting off the Spanish for a decade, eventually winning its independence from Spain along with Mexico, becoming the capital of the new and free State of Zacatecas in 1823.\n\nDuring the era of the 19th century, Zacatecas would become a growing center for the arts as part of a series of rapid modernization under the dictatorship of the Porfiriato, one that would be interrupted by the Mexican Revolution, where the city would become the site of the legendary, day-long battle where Pancho Villa's rebels triumphed over the army of Victoriano Huerta, considered by many to be one of the greatest and bloodiest battles of the revolution.\n\nIn the later half of the 20th century, the city has fallen on rough times; Mexican Revolution caused enough damage to the city to trigger a demographic freefall and atrophy, with parts of the city appearing almost abandoned. This lack of development crippled the economy of the city and lead to decades recession and decline, both made worse with the depletion of the cities silver deposits and little in the form of international investment.\n\nNot all is bleak in Zacatecas, however; the lack of development in the city allowed for it to retain a much older and more traditionally Mexican visual appearance and aesthetic, which has since allowed for the city to transition its economy towards tourism and commerce, with slow but moderate success."

Originally the crossing between the state of Missouri and the unorganized territory, with the signing of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, the city found itself in political limbo between the Free-Staters and Border Ruffians during the Bleeding Kansas period and into the Civil War as pro-Union and pro-Confederate paramilitaries clashed.\n\nPost-war, the city was at a literal crossroads. Being home to the Missouri River railroad bridge and Union Station, the city saw rapid economic growth from the New York-Kansas City-New Orleans rail line, with cultural exports from both cities pouring from the railway line.\n\nWith the end of WW2 and the creation of the Interstate Highway System, Kansas City has once again found itself at a crossroads, and with a unique opportunity. At the intersection of I-70 and I-35, its influence spans nearly the entire latitude and longitude of the contiguous United States, and with the continued expansion of both it and the old rail system, the city is poised to be one of the most important in America in the following century."

Calgary became like many towns that made up the American Wild West, with a dysfunctional local government and a slow economy. Despite the poor start, the city quickly grew into an economic and cultural center. The Calgary Stampede is an annual rodeo that's among the largest in the world. The discovery of oil has made it the center of the city's economy, which has also become the focus of Alberta's disputes with the government.

This opened the city to international trade and the city grew in wealth and size because of this trade.\n\nBut the end of the Second World War and the division of the world between fascist regimes and democracies signaled a decline for Vancouver.

There are many Americans across the Metroplex opposed to the likes of Ted Dealey, whose ultra-conservative paper castigates Nixon and Kennedy as allies of socialism, communism, and the pope. There are many who march in opposition of the completely segregated school system, even as the powerful Baptist preacher W. A. Criswell snarls about the threat of the NAACP and CPUSA.

From there, it winds downstream, picking up width and speed until it turns into the force of God that defines the lands around it. It's during this early stage that the Old Man River cuts through the Twin Cities - Minneapolis and Saint Paul.\n\nMinneapolis began as land on a military base. Saint Paul was a collection of small villages. Saint Paul is the last city in the East, they say, and Minneapolis is the first city in the West. Minneapolis styles itself with urban renewal and modern architecture while Saint Paul maintains a classic Victorian style. The cities may be split physically by the river and their many differences, but their inexorable ties to one another have grown and flourished, developing a rich history and culture forged by freezing temperatures. Together they share the 7-time champion Golden Gophers, the newly founded Vikings, and the aptly named Twins, as well as economic prosperity and a strong hold over state politics.\n\nEven in the Minnesota cold, the heated rivalry between the two cities has defined their histories to the point of competitive cathedral building, architectural blacklisting, and even the kidnapping of census takers to prevent one city from being deemed larger than the other. Yet today, the internal troubles of each city is the focus of much concern. Both cities contend with unofficial segregation and deep roots of discrimination, despite their liberal tendencies. Both cities struggle with declining populations and labor disputes. Both cities pour effort into distinguishing themselves among the manufacturing metropolises of the Midwest who so often command the attention of America.\n\nStill, through the blizzards and tornadoes, the strikes and the riots, the decline of industry and the tensions of the Cold War, Minneapolis-Saint Paul endures and innovates.

For many, their last place of rest and preparation before the venture was in a blooming town on the Missouri River. This is the city of Omaha, Nebraska, the Gateway to the West.\n\nOmaha is the second-largest city on the Great Plains today, home to over 300,000 people and swiftly rising. The imposing brick silhouettes of Jobbers Canyon form the heart of the burgeoning meatpacking and agricultural industry which dominates the local economy, while the golden fields of the Big O's surroundings are filled with wheat, corn, and other grains. Just a few miles south is the University of Nebraska, the largest college in the state and home to a resurgent Cornhuskers football team. When the sun sets on the prairie, you can count on the theaters and venues of the city's North Side to spill jazz and blues into the streets, the rich music developed by the sizeable Black population which calls Omaha their home.\n\nBut just as anvil clouds on the horizon signal incoming thunderstorms, so too does trouble creep towards the city. Rumors of railroad and meatpacking industry restructures threaten a massive wave of layoffs among the impoverished North Side, predominantly targeting Black laborers. While Nebraska has no segregation nor slaver history on the books, the city is governed unofficially by an everpresent policy of redlining and secret covenants keeping the communities apart, only recently even being challenged. Wealth disparity between White and Black citizens is among the highest in the nation. Tensions, always present and always bubbling, threaten to explode as the Civil Rights movement steams on - and, if the Red Summer of 1919 bears any relevance to today, an explosion means riots, lynchings, bloodshed, and death.\n\nOmaha teeters on the precipice of the future - economically as precarious as Detroit or Toledo, racially as fragile as Birmingham or Montgomery. Its fate relies as much upon itself as it does on the nation around it. What way America falls may decide whether Omaha has summer days or tornado season ahead."

Get closer and you can hear the saxophones and organs of jazz and soul sweep in alongside the drums and bass. Once you see the L&C Tower and the sound becomes overpowering, you know you've made it. This is Music City, where the dreams of country's most talented artists come to make their name.\n\nNashville finds its beginnings as a fort built during the Revolutionary War. Its strategic position on the Cumberland River instantly made it a quickly growing investment, both for military and economic purposes, and the city exploded in popularity as more Americans moved over the Appalachians. The Civil War mostly passed the city by, save for the early occupation by Federal forces and the Battle of Nashville in 1864, and that relative intactness allowed the city to prosper in the Reconstruction era and beyond. Healthcare, music, and universities such as Vanderbilt, Belmont, Tennessee State, and others have all become vital to the city's economy and culture, leading to the nickname "The Athens of the South".\n\nThe Athens of the South, however, is plagued by its original sin of slavery. Segregation and discrimination is buried deeply into Nashville's roots. The city itself was founded with slaves to work the streets. The Civil War ended the direct ownership of Black Americans, but Reconstruction brought no racial progress. The Daughters of the Confederacy made their home first in Nashville, and the first incarnation of the Klan found the city as one of its earliest hotbeds. The gruesome lynching of Ephraim Gizzard was only the beginning of the long, arduous, and brutal fight for equality in the city.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement has not left Nashville alone. Recent years have seen some steps forwards in the move towards equality, but the systems of segregation remain in place both officially and unofficially. Tensions smolder under the neon exterior of the clubs and the studios. Still, the people of the city have a lot to look ahead to. The healthcare industry is booming, outside companies are making their new home in the city, and the road for music's best keep leading to Tennessee. At the end of the day, as long as the guitars keep playing and the organs keep sounding their notes, Music City remains hopeful for a brighter future ahead."

In the February cold, they left Nauvoo and trekked into the great unknown, slogging through mud and forced to drag themselves through mountains. It took until July 1847 for the first set of Mormon eyes to fall upon the Salt Lake Valley and the massive body of water beside it, nestled in the heart of the Great Basin - but when Brigham Young saw the view, he knew he had found their new home.\n\nAmerica caught up with the pioneers within the next 3 years, but the Mormons have never left. Through food shortages, harsh weather, armed conflicts, and disease, they staked their claim to their new lands tenaciously. In today's America, Salt Lake City is unique in its status as the largest majority-Mormon city in the country, the headquarters of the LDS church and the site of the gigantic Salt Lake Temple. Religion shows itself in the culture, the universities, the politics, and the people of the region. Few, if any, other cities in America can claim such united worship.\n\nTo focus on nothing more than Mormonism when talking about the Crossroads of the West, however, is to dismiss the culture of almost 200,000 Americans. The beauty of the mountain ranges which make up the edge of the valley is unparalleled, not to mention the strong skiing and hiking scene that comes with them. Beneath their snow-capped exterior, too, are arteries of silver and ore which have made up the bedrock of the region since the 1850's. The city itself, connected by its massive blocks and six-lane streets, has theaters, parks, and a small but vibrant music scene. Finally, of course, there's the eponymous Great Salt Lake, the habitat for millions of birds and scene of trails and tourism.\n\nSalt Lake City has its problems, of course. Growth is stagnating, the city is expected to begin declining in population, and the Church's influence can be as much a hindrance as it can be a help. Yet, despite all this, perhaps Brigham Young's words when he first saw the new home for his Church still apply.\n\n"This is the right place," he said. "Drive on.""

Founded at the end of the XIX century by Menelik, Emperor of Ethiopia, as the first proper imperial capital, the city grew rapidly with the influx of trade and immigrants from the poorer regions of the burgeoning Empire: the construction of the first railway in an independent African nation further accelerated its development, which only continued under Italian occupation, if for an entirely different purpose.\n\nAs the largest city in the newly-expanded Italian colonial domain, Addis Ababa, soon christened as the "Flower of the Empire" from its colonial coat of arms, was immediately chosen as the seat of the Viceroy, and a large portion of the city was soon demolished to make space for the designs of its new owners. Wide avenues, majestic triumphal arches and modern Italian-style quarters impress an indelible mark upon the city, while the nobility and middle class of the defeated enemy were pushed into ever-expanding slums: there, Italian Blackshirts and native African Policemen make sure that any challenge to the Italian order is quelled with prejudice.\n\nWith half a million inhabitants, a large industrial sector, and a labyrinthine bureaucracy, Addis Ababa is the largest city in the Horn of Africa. As such, different rules apply than the rest of the colony: with the impossibility to control the entirety of such a sprawling urban center, the racial order is enforced with way less zeal, and it is not uncommon to see poor Italian colonists live and work side by side with locals, a coexistence unseen in other parts of Italian Africa and which has led to the formation of what many call a unique underground culture."

Sold by the local rulers to Italian traders, it soon became the epicenter of the Italian colonial expansion in Somalia: slowly but steadily, the city expanded as more and more colonists found a new life outside of the mainland, until they outnumbered the natives, and started pushing them towards the outskirts in large slums, rebuilding the city center in the image of a typical Italian town.\n\nWhile less developed than Addis Ababa or Asmara, Mogadishu is still an important urban center, with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants and several industries - especially in the textile and fruit sectors - marking its progress from a mere trade and agricultural town into a modern industrial city. As Italy's main port into the Indian Ocean, Mogadishu also boasts a large and modern port: every day, dozens of cargo ships dock here to load Somalia's fruits and textiles, exporting them towards Italy or other countries."

Boasting a population of almost two hundred thousands, almost two thirds of which Italian, the regional capital of Eritrea is also the second most industrialized city in Italian East Africa after Addis Ababa itself, with several subsidiaries of Italian industries such as FIAT and Ansaldo, as well as an important recruitment center: the Ascari are, in fact, the main pillar upon which the colonial garrison relies upon, and their veterans often receive land and pensions which elevate them far above their brethren.\n\nUnder the shiny façade of a bustling city, however, lies the ugly truth of colonial occupation. Far from the beautiful parks and modern service buildings of the city center, Asmara's outskirts are occupied by slums where tens of thousands of natives live in extremely poor conditions, while unofficial, but deeply entrenched, bureaucratic practices make sure that few, if any native can have a chance to increase their status if not by enlisting in the Ascari: this situation is not only known, but to some extent encouraged by the government in Rome, as the Italianization of the province proceeds."

The strain has not been kind on their aging figures.\n\nParamaribo, for its part, has become the unwitting and unwilling host to this drama. There's certainly an irony to its settlement, being a colonial project planted right on top of an old native village.

Soon, it also became a colonial lynchpin in the struggle between imperial powers, eventually trading hands from Spain to Britain. With that came a new wave of colonists - Indians from the then-Raj, settling and mixing in with the European, African, and indigenous population that had already settled there.\n\nModern times dawn upon a Trinidad that holds itself as one of the most diverse places in the world, with the capital city of one of the most diverse countries in the world. The West Indies Federation is charitably described as eclectic, realistically described as dysfunctional, and rumored by many to be on the verge of collapse. A perhaps ill-advised union between the old colonial islands of the Caribbean has created a gridlocked, argumentative, and disunited country that seems to exist only so far as people acknowledge it. Port of Spain has its own local problems too, of course - Williams' dominance may be fairly won, but his seeming reluctance to address racial issues has left many dissatisfied, and the weakness of the Union invites foreign interference from all players of the Cold War. Still, nothing can deny that the world seems to be laid out before the city on the Caribbean coast. If all goes well, they may just be able to reach out and harness it."

Now, with the British having packed their bags and left, tens of thousands of Guyanans call it home.\n\nYet the stain of centuries of colonialism have not left Guyana in practice, even if they find themselves independent in name. The American occupation was brief, but its legacy has tied the nation into the OFN and into America's economic hold on the nation. The British are gone, but their money and their businessmen remain. Despite the ocean between themselves and Europe, the concerns of the Cold War can't help but drag themselves through Guyanan concerns, a specter looming over their ambitions. Finally, over the border looms the Venezuelans, arrogant enough to claim nearly half the country for themselves and powerful enough to see it through should America ever cut loose from the country.\n\nAnd yet... Georgetown itself sees peace, or at least an uneasy form of it. The wide boulevards and canals host witness to economic growth, and the streets are lush with vibrant plantlife while citizens go on with their lives. The legislature may be sharply divided, the country may be balanced on knife's edge, but the city itself seems frozen in a bubble of tranquility. Time will tell if it ever pops."

In the dark era of La Violencia, Bolívar's vengeful aspirations - To whip Pasto into a military Colony - were realized as the region transformed into a repressed, heavily surveilled borderland. Even today, it remains among the most oppressed regions within the State of the New Granada, its inhabitants subjected to unrelenting scrutiny and persecution, with only their sacred religious landmarks spared from the vicious grasp of repression."

Adorned with opulent cathedrals and awe-inspiring religious architecture, this city, founded in 1537, serves as a guardian of precious religious artifacts and ancient texts once belonging to the Spanish Empire, including the esteemed Crown of the Andes.\n\nTime has woven a tapestry of constancy in Popayán's fabric, resilient against the tumult of La Violencia and the shifting tides of Colombian history. Nestled within its agrarian embrace, the city remains a bastion of tradition, untouched by towering skyscrapers or modern feats of infrastructure. Some may view this as a stroke of fortune for the Payanese people, shielded from the rapid pace and upheaval that often accompany urban expansion and spared from the ravages of war that have plagued much of their nation's history.\n\nIn this harmonious haven, time seems to have paused, preserving the city's essence and allowing its inhabitants to retain the tranquil rhythms of a bygone era. Popayán stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of tradition and the unyielding devotion to faith that permeates its streets. Within its timeless embrace, the white city continues to captivate, beckoning visitors to bask in its sacred aura and immerse themselves in the living history that unfolds before their eyes."

While its precise founding remains shrouded in mystery, historical records indicate that Villavicencio was officially established as a municipality by the provincial assembly of Bogotá in 1840, solidifying its status as a republican city, since in colonial times it was marked just as a hub for Jesuit missions, connecting surrounding estates and facilitating the transportation of agricultural goods to larger towns.\n\nSituated to the east of the majestic Andean range and propelled by a thriving petrochemical industry, Villavicencio found itself shielded from the grotesque scenes that unfolded during La Violencia.

By 1962, the city has recovered much from its troubles in the first half of the 20th century, and despite being a smaller city now, it has seen waves of investments from American corporations which many see as a sign of the changes to come for Mexico in the second half of the 20th century."

Now the capital of the state of Tamaulipas, the city grew steadily through the course of the 19th century. Unlike other cities in Mexico, the city did not see a significant decline during the Revolution and survived the conflict relatively unscathed.\n\nThe recent decades have seen the city grow massively as its industry has prospered thanks to the work of the Mexican miracle. Many see the success of Ciudad Victoria as a vision of what prosperity can bring to all of Mexico, with the city being held up as a gold standard of what the country should strive to be."

The city itself is relatively flat, and has prospered thanks to its position on the coast of the Gulf of Cortes—to which the city owes its existence. For much of Mexico's history, the city has been largely unremarkable, living through the ups and downs of Mexican history much like any other. By the 1950s, however, the city saw a remarkable shift as a wave of prosperity and growth transformed the once backwater city lying on a sparsely populated peninsula into a hub of commerce and tourism.\n\nLa Paz now stands as a testament to the success of the Mexican Miracle, a symbol of prosperity and progress for the Mexican people. It is also a symbol of the growing power of the Baja California Peninsula, perhaps heralding a new strength for the once forgotten people of this far northwestern territory."

As the city grew with the years passing by it was one of the first captured by the Revolution, by the army of Obregón and Carranza no less.\n\nIts economy boomed with the automobile industry in the 1920's, and it was renamed to honor General Álvaro Obregón. From what started as being a glorified train stop, it now possesses the title of the second largest city in the state of Sonora. Despite the desert terrain Ciudad Obregón finds itself in, it has continued to grow massively, with its proximity to a valley making it a hub of countless agricultural experiments.

It has long played an important role in Mexican history given its strategic location in the Bajio. Sieged during the independence war, it later was attacked by the French during their invasion of Mexico, and still further by Porfirio Díaz during his coup in 1876. It even saw one of the bloodiest battles of the Revolution, as in 1915 the armies of Pancho Villa and Álvaro Obregón clashed in a horrific bloodletting.\n\nIn the aftermath, Celaya was left a wasteland with little hope to recover. And yet, as it always has, it grew from the conflicts of its past to embrace the promises of the future. By the 1960s, the city has bounced back as its recovery has turned into an economic boom. Coupled with its strong infrastructure and commerce given its placement in the Bajio, it is becoming colloquially known as the "Golden Gate of the Bajio", only further enhancing its growing prosperity."

The name translates to "Hot Waters", deriving from the location of the city itself: within the valleys lie an abundance of hot springs dotting the mountains of the Bajio. Founded in 1575 by a group of Spanish adventurers, its original purpose was to protect the roads connecting the massive mines of central Mexico. Over the ensuing centuries, the city grew from its original purpose as its population swelled. Under the Porfiriato, it saw an industrial boom. Yet its place in history was cemented in 1914 by the Convention of Aguascalientes, which sought to unite the revolutionaries of Mexico under one banner.\n\nToday, Aguascalientes continues much as it had before, with the economy rolling smoothly along as it benefits from its enviable position within the prosperous Bajio and its centrality.

Over the ensuing decades, its name shifted as the identity of Mexico grew, and the city became the capital of the province of New Galicia. With its medium altitude and its location near the coast, it became intertwined with the trade networks connecting the Philippines, Guadalajara, and Mexico City. Over the following centuries the city continued to swell in population, yet it saw a decline in the 19th century as other cities rose in prominence.\n\nAlthough a shadow of what it once was, Tepic remains the capital of the state of Nayarit. Its industrialization efforts in the first half of the 20th century saw its population explode. With its position still of great importance to the Mexican economy and its trade networks, the future of Tepic looks bright as it is poised to become a central link in Mexico's growing trade in the Pacific."

That wealth kept flowing until Indian plantations displaced Chinese ones in the global economy.\n\nYet at the same time that tea went out and assorted foreigners went in—Gulangyu Island is known for its colonial architecture—Xiamen was considered decrepit, the dirtiest city in China. Today, things have not truly improved.

It turned out that neither the rise of the Qing, nor the revolt of the Taiping, nor even the chaos of the Century of Humiliation could truly keep Suzhou down.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Suzhou's proximity both to Japan and to Nanjing rendered a return to relative wealth inevitable. Many of the classical gardens, such as the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden, have been restored, and economic output is on the way up.

Historically a commercial centre for trade as it facilitated overland routes to Canton from the north, its economic importance declined following the devastation of the Taiping Rebellion. It is in Nanchang where the Kuomintang and the Communists first came to blows in 1927, the latter successfully occupying the city for a few days before escaping a subsequent siege by National Revolutionary Army forces.\n\nThis Nationalist victory allowed Nanchang to become a stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek's government, meaning that even when it fell to the Japanese in the Spring of 1939 it would not submit so easily to military authority. Nor did it take well to the rule of the collaborators—the Jiangxi Provincial Government would have to move its operations to Jiujiang before the war's end, such was the fervour of resistance in the city.\n\nDespite being eventually pacified, to this day many in Nanchang remain in discontent with the so-called Republic of China, and the central government in Nanjing certainly returns the sentiment, with every year bringing less funding for development. This money is instead spent on ensuring the local police have sturdier batons to knuckle heads together with. While still the nominal core of Jiangxi as its capital—and still strategically important for the central government— Nanchang is clearly a shell of its former self, while the new developing cities in the region such as Jiujiang and Ganjiang creep out of the shade to take their place in the sun."

When the latter became a special municipality directly administered by the central government in Nanjing, Yichang replaced it as the new capital of Hubei. As a gateway to the province of Sichuan through the Yangtze River through the Three Gorges, Yichang is a strategically important city both economically and militarily. It was this strategic value, on the other hand, that made it one of the most ravaged cities throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War. The city's population sharply dropped amid the devastation of war.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the war, an influx of immigrants from the rural towns and villages—as well as neighbouring provinces— heavily contributed to the revitalisation of Yichang. In recent years it has bloomed thanks to new trade opportunities and economic activity, no doubt helped by the popularity of their two primary exports, citrus and tea.\n\nDespite all this prosperity, the locals in Yichang have still not forgotten and certainly have not forgiven the tyranny of the Japanese occupiers and their puppets in Nanjing. Some may be vocal in their resistance, yes, but their discontent is increasingly deafened by the swelling number of immigrants who simply hope for a better life in the boomtown capital."

Hengyang was founded towards the end of the Warring States era, emerging as an area of strategic importance. It became the capital for regional administration within Hunan under the Tang Dynasty, and was renamed as a new polity was founded in Hunan during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. From there, it became a thorn in the side of local occupiers, being the site of uprisings against Yuan rule in opposition to altered grain quotas. \n\nThe city continued to develop through the following centuries, often renamed to suit the objectives of local rulers. By the turn of the twentieth century, it developed into a major commercial hub, prospering as business moved inland. However, as the Second Sino-Japanese War dragged on, Hengyang became a frontline city, and the site of perhaps the conflict's fiercest fighting. Seeing significant pressure from incendiary weaponry and poison gas, the city itself was practically levelled by fighting, ending the war as little more than a disorganised pile of rubble. \n\nLittle has changed. The streets themselves have been restored, the fruits of later efforts made to reconstruct the city, with significant investment poured into the city to restore it as a shining jewel of pan-Asianism. What business still lingers in the city continues to thrive, whilst the Reorganised National Government of China places significant investment and resources into the city in an effort to maintain it as a bastion against other regional polities. However, such bribery cannot eliminate the disgust that those living in Hengyang feel towards the regime, and as they rankle, they dream of liberation from the yoke of the puppet regime."

In its heyday it was one of the most prosperous cities in Imperial China, primarily due to its strategic position along the ancient Silk Road and the mining of its renowned Dushan jade; attracting traders, artisans, and merchants from across the empire and beyond. it has fallen behind newer cities in the region in recent years, such as Xinyang to the southeast. The causes are endless: the river transportation system, once crucial for the movement of goods and people, has suffered as the rise of the railway industry has shifted trade routes away from the waterways, overexploitation of fish stocks and forests, pillaging from warlords during the Republican Era, as well as relentless natural disasters that bring the threat of outright famine.\n\nAs a result, the Nanyang Basin is ripe with peasant banditry, something that the central government in Nanjing is well aware of. Realising the importance of securing control in the region, the Reorganised Government of China has reconstituted Henan Province by centralising control in Nanyang, making it a base of operations for fighting the bandits along the basin. While a decent first step, it is clear that redrawing the map alone won't solve the bandit problem.

Things could not possibly get any worse is the mantra of the day, rather than any sort of patriotic support for the collaborators. The Reorganised Government of China recognised the value and potential of Zhengzhou as a city of national importance, and negotiated to the bitter end with the Japanese to have the city's administration transferred from the North China Political Council to the Nanjing government, to which Japan reluctantly agreed. Ever since the transfer of sovereignty, Zhengzhou has served as the provincial capital of Zhongyuan Province.\n\nSince Zhengzhou is more docile and somewhat receptive to RGOC rule than other cities, the city is a major beneficiary of government funding and aid. This, combined with its strategic location, has made Zhengzhou one of the most rapid-growing cities in the country owing to its status as a hub for both trade and transportation. It has essentially surpassed Kaifeng to the east as the core city of the region, spearheading new developments in the spinning and weaving industries, coal mining, and machinery production.

After the war, its operational importance warranted a massive leap in its status - under the new administrative division of the Wangite ROC and the NCPC, Shimen became the capital of the redrawn province of Hebei.

Then Shanggu, the city slowly grew in strength, benefitting from its region's association with the Northern Song and becoming the site of numerous armies, before being ransacked by the Mongol Empire in 1213. \n\nDespite this, the city would later recover, benefiting from its location and receiving significant aid, returning to its former role as a burgeoning population centre and becoming the capital of Zhili in 1667. The city slowly begun to industrialise before attention came in the waning years of the Qing Empire as a new academy was founded, serving as the backbone for a modernising military. The city fell to Japanese forces early into the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was integrated fairly quickly. \n\nBaoding stretches, however desperately, back towards its lengthy history. The Baoding Military Academy retains its prestige as a cradle of modern Chinese military tactics, and on being the origins of many influential figures across China. However, prestige can only carry a city so far. Despite being designated as the capital of Zhili Province once more, the rise of cities such as Tianjin and Shimen, alongside the exploitative practices of Japan itself have all led to the city's relative decline, only benefitting off the loose spoils of Beijing's growth.

Under Qi Shi Huang, efforts to build a canal connecting the Xiang and Li River came to benefit the city, allowing it to grow into a burgeoning commercial centre, a factor boosted further as campaigns saw China expand southwards.\n\nGuilin became a provincial capital under Emperor Gaozong, prospering under the Tang and Song dynasties as the city became a connecting sinew between the central government and the southern border. It was the residence of Zhu Shouqian, driving further attention towards the city, and maintaining its position as the capital of Guangxi. Under the Republic of China, the city was briefly superseded by Nanning as the capital of Guangxi Province, before the title was returned in 1932 over security returned.

As the location of major landmarks such as the Sanctuary of Kumbum (also known as Ta'er Monastery) and the Dongguan Mosque, it is important to many of the non-Han ethnicities of the region, such as Tibetans.\n\nThe core of Qinghai ever since its detachment from Gansu to become the capital of its current province in 1928, it is also the headquarters of the Qinghai Ma clique. Because of that fact, it is another center of the Northwest exile Government under the Diarchy.

Originally named "Rasa," meaning "Fortified City," it was chosen by Songtsen Gampo in 633 AD as the seat of the Tibetan Empire. Later, the development of Tibetan Buddhism would make Lhasa become known as the "Place of the Gods," shaping the city into what we know today.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Empire, the Tibetan Plateau was plagued by centuries of warlordism, dimming Lhasa's sacred light. Its greatness was only restored in the 16th century with the establishment of the Ganden Phodrang regime. From that point on, Lhasa has remained the heart of Tibet, and the beauty of the Potala Palace stands unshaken despite the passage of time.\n\nHowever, not even the holy city can escape the tides of history forever. From the Qing Empire to the Republic of China, from the British to the Indians, foreign influences have gradually made their way into Lhasa, disrupting the long-standing status quo of the Tibetan people. Under the gaze of the young Dalai Lama, Lhasa's future is uncertain, and only time can tell how the city will weather the storms ahead."

With its origins uncertain, the county emerged through the haze of the Warring States as an administrative centre, with the city being founded under the Qin Dynasty and briefly serving as the capital of the Han Dynasty under Emperor Gaozu. For a time, Nanzheng served as the economic and political centre of Hanzhong, becoming the capital of an assortment of local districts. Guarding the only roads to the Sichuan Basin, Nanzheng has long been contested for its strategic location, well-known as the frontline against Wei in the Three Kingdoms, and the Jin in the Song Dynasty.\n\nFrom there, though, the city began to fade from the spotlight it had once endured, superseded by other cities in the area even its military value was still admired. As the Beiyang Government actively collapsed, the city fell under the control of the Guominjun and the NRA, before ultimately coming under the loose grip of the Co-Prosperity Sphere as the Second Sino-Japanese War drew down in intensity.\n\nSince the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nanzheng has ostensibly had the privilege of being the capital of Hanzhong Province, a beneficiary of an administrative reorganisation. However, in practice, there is no local government. With the sheer strength of partisan movements, and with the threat to other neighbouring provinces posed by it, any offices opened have remained open to nobody for decades. Lax oversight has allowed Nanzheng to become a centre for the smuggling of drugs, weapons and the black market, ironically helping to strengthen and enrich the city in a manner that has otherwise eluded it for the past few centuries."

 state_lore_desc.386: "The Land of the Thirteen Kingdoms, Dihua was once the confluence of a number of settlements, standing on a valuable chokepoint across the Silk Road. Efforts from China to consolidate the region spanned numerous dynasties over numerous centuries, slowly formalising as small settlements on the location of modern Dihua were formed to handle local administration. Dihua itself was founded in 1755 in the wake of the Dzungar Genocide, being built and expanding around a local army barracks next to another new city.\n\nThe two cities expanded through the nineteenth century, attracting attention from merchants as Han, Hui and Manchurian settlers enabled rapid expansion. As it rapidly expanded, interest grew in the city, being regarded as a shining example of eastern Chinese culture transferred over to Turkestan. It grew to supersede other regional cities in strength, becoming the capital of Xinjiang Province in 1884. When the Republic of China collapsed, Dihua became the capital of a local warlord, undergoing a procession of leaders and struggling with a series of extended revolts among Uyghur opponents to continued Han rule, before slowly beginning to ossify as Japan exerted its control over East Asia, and as the United Front retreated further inland.\n\nToday, Dihua stands at a crossroads, shorn once again between its origins and its heartland. Continued attempts to encourage Han settlement have failed, and have only served as fuel for the rage of many Uyghurs across the province. The Kuomintang struggles to govern the city, aided by the remnants of the CPC and sympathetic Uyghur and Hui groups. In many ways, Dihua has begun to decline, isolated from the wider world and frozen in the 1930s. The city might be able to withstand stagnation for another decade - but what comes next?"

Founded under the Han Dynasty, Kangding's history is murky through the following centuries, serving as a settlement just outside of China's reach, slowly developing as an extension of Tibet. During the tenth century, efforts were made to integrate the region, but this was only partial, with the city maintaining autonomy beyond a local administrator. The city slowly settled into this rough arrangement, inheriting the autonomy of Tibet until its integration into the Qing in 1727 as it was moved over to Sichuan Province.\n\nFrom here, it became a major component of efforts to integrate the Khams, one complicated by the Batang Uprising of 1905. As the British Empire attempted to exert its influence in Tibet following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, the city's importance in trade led to the brief opening of a consulate in the area, though it would later be drawn down. Staunchly supportive of the Kuomintang and the Second United Front, Kangding became a refuge for NRA soldiers as fighting drew further inland, and towards guerrilla tactics.\n\nOn paper, Kangding is still the capital of Xikang, serving an administrative function whilst still continuing to be the connecting sinew between China and Tibet. However, the consequences of Japan's dominance in China has altered that. Whilst still incredibly popular, most influential figures now reside in Ya'an or Xichang, and the true seat of power has shifted eastward, away from the former gateway. Smuggling is a local feature, but the greatest import today are European visitors, professing an interest in the local, albeit reduced, Archdiocese whose intentions remain a mystery."

From between the bones of ancient, half-forgotten monarchs, Khüree was initially founded in 1639 as a mobile monastery, moving between locations as it slowly amassed followers and devoted monks. It slowly gained an increasingly administrative function, claiming a growing degree of authority in hosting the Khan's court and judiciary. Meanwhile, it also slowly progressed into a major point for the trade of furs, cloth and tea, attracting significant Russian attention through the eighteenth century.\n\nAs the Qing Empire hurtled towards total collapse, Khüree became the capital of an officially independent Mongolia, a state only briefly given full, tumultuous independence. Nonetheless, Khüree remained the capital of Mongolia, benefitting from the Siberian Plan advanced under Nikolai Bukharin as it begun to industrialise. The city suffered during the Siberian Intervention, shorn between a collapsing Soviet Union and, ultimately, Japanese advances. Although it lost the official title of capital, Khüree is still a preeminent city, and has remained an important judicial and commercial centre.\n\nToday, Khüree has managed to hold onto its preeminent position in Mongolia. Remaining a major religious centre, its swelling population expands even further during the numerous religious festivals hosted in the city. Echoes of Bukharin, the corpse of another regime, still echoes across the city, serving as the foundations for occasional dissents that persist in spite of the best efforts of the IJA. As time goes on, and as the foundations of his legacy are slowly expanded on, Khüree will play a pivotal role in the integration of Mongolia into the wider Sphere."

While the claim on the territory by the French has existed for centuries, with the place occasionally being visited by whalers and scientists, it took the scramble for Antarctica in the 50s for anything resembling civilization to take root on the Kerguelen islands. Hastily assembled on behalf of the Germans as a transit point in their conquest of Neuschwabenland, a flurry of activity and investment turned the rocky islands into a functional military base, complete with an airstrip and harbor.\n\nManned primarily by the French with a small German garrison, life has changed little for the residents of Port-aux-Français. Struggling to hold together a fracturing empire, Paris has put only the bare minimum investment into the base to maintain their role as a glorified, though essential, supply depot for Neuschwabenland. Attempts have been made to make the residents feel at home, from the concrete chapel of Notre-Dame des Vents to the ramshackle local pâtisserie, though none are truly successful. Barbed wire and fortifications litter the coast, but few hold anything more than penguin droppings these days. Chances of invasion are remote, and the weather worn german garrison has diminished in the wake of redeployments to more crucial theatres.\n\nIt would seem the only people not miserable in this darkened land, are the small group of civilians seeking their fortune in the whaling industry or the burgeoning field of oceanography, most prominent among them filmmaker and adventurer Jacques Cousteau.

But since an intensive development effort so that the city could host an airbase in the Second World War, Macapá's fortunes have shifted. The recent discovery of Manganese deposits in Amapá has prompted a flurry of private investment centered on the territory's capital, pulling in thousands of mainly Paraense residents every year.

Even today, there is only a single settlement of note: Boa Vista. Being situated in the driest portion of the whole Amazon basin, where the rainforest thins into savannah, it could not develop the rubber industry that defines the rest of Northern Brazil, but is well-placed for soybean farming and cattle rearing that feed the citizens of Amazonas and Pará.

Porto Velho was established at its end to move latex from traincars onto cargo ships, and until recently, this trade represented virtually all of Roraima's economy. But with the recent discovery of large tin deposits and rapidly rising demand for wood and beef, the territory is rapidly diversifying, and Rio Velho is diversifying in tandem.

These settlers, soon joined by hundreds of others from Brazil and Bolivia, enslaved thousands of natives in their lust for latex, becoming the 'Rubber Barons' that dominate Acre to this day. When Bolivia began policing the territory, the barons revolted, and in 1903 secured incorporation into Brazil.

Were it not made the capital of the enormous Mato Grosso, it is doubtful the city would have even survived past the end of its 18th century gold rush.

By 1900 it had evolved into the bridge by which southern Mato-grossense farmers could export their soybean and cotton to the coast. With a distinct culture grown out of German and Italian heritage, and a lack of connections to Cuiabá, the south has developed with a highly distinct identity and largely separate economy.

Today Curitiba is one of the largest and wealthiest of all Brazilian cities, but as the world is torn asunder by the Cold War, it is increasingly a city divided against itself.

Massive investment in the following decades culminated in the opening of a port in 1940, which is now the beating heart of a thriving trading hub. Vitória is famous for its natural beauty, with the city's delayed development having left the surrounding rainforest intact, and its lack of heavy industry making it perhaps the least polluted city in the country.

Belo Horizonte was inaugurated as the new capital in 1897. Within thirty years of its founding, it grew into Brazil's first true inland metropolis: where once the hinterlands of Minas Gerais simply exported its raw materials to the coast, now they supply thriving steel mills and cement plants in the capital. Such rapid growth necessitated sweeping infrastructure expansion under mayor Juscelino Kubitschek in the 40s; thus began the career of a man who would one day be president and apply his approach to urban development nationwide.

Due to its strategic position, Hainan has attracted the attention of various imperial powers in Modern History, but infightings among the Imperialists had fortunately freed the provinces from the consequences of colonialism - until the annexation by Imperial Japan, which plunged Hainan into the darkest and bloodiest era in its history.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy reluctantly transferred Hainan's ownership to the Republic of China per the Treaty of Guangdong. With the majority of Guangdong in the hands of Japan and local warlords now, Hainan remains the last stronghold of the province under the control of the Nanjing Government, who allowed Hainan to be ruled autonomously as a 'Special Administrative Region' in an attempt to win over the Guangdong population.\n\nToday, Haikou serves as the capital of the Hainan SAR and one of the busiest transit ports in the Republic of China. However, beneath the prosperity of Haikou lies the frustration of the silent majority, who have never forgotten the scars left by the imperialists—as well as those collaborators who not only turned a blind eye to such tyranny but also betrayed their homeland."

From Achaemenid Persia and Alexander's Greeks, to Ancient Roman and the Byzantines, to the Ottoman and Russian Empires, all the way to the war of the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany. Sitting on a historic byway between Europe, the Islamic world and western Asia, Baku has played host to the conquering armies half the world over.\n\nWith the advent of the world's growing reliance on petroleum following the First World War, it did not take long for Baku's importance to Azerbaijan's vast Oil extraction industry to become visible to those who lived in it, nevermind to those who lived without. Therefore, when the armies of Germany marched into Bukarin's Russia, toppled the Azerbaijan SSR and integrated the Azeri lands into the Reichskommissariat Kaukasien, Baku soon became a hub for the Third Reich's resource extraction machine, playing off Germany's reputation as the liberator of the Caucasus so long as the Oil in Baku keeps flowing.\n\nLike a number of places in Germany's southernmost lebensraum, Baku purchases it's peace in black gold, where the limited autonomy granted by the Germans to Azeri has proven 'workable' for the civilian population in the city. An unease looms over the city, however, for the sight of Wehrmacht Halftracks parading beneath the Palace of the Shirvanshahs makes some wonder if the future holds something grim in the grand city's near future…"

Once the territory that represented the epitome of Roman conquests, the Punic state has faded for millennia into the modern form, a place crossed between a queer brand of Arabic traditionalism and colonial constitution.\n\nThe history of Tunis was cosmopolitan since its inception — the Semitic Phoenicians founded upon this patch of land a formidable empire, and the Romans rendered the port ashes in months. As both nations eventually fell, Arabic settlers arrived en masse, which brought along a period of reconstruction and Islamization, where the city's populace became devout Muslims subservient to the many caliphates. From the native Almohads to the Ottoman Turks, the Tunisians were a faithful lot for centuries.\n\nRegardless of the faces those rulers wore, Tunis remained in a perpetual cycle of salting and recuperating, with the French imperials who arrived a few decades ago as the builders who brought commerce to the then-failing beylik. Following past patterns, as French Africa collapsed, Mussolini was ever eager to retrieve this centerpiece of Pax Romana into his holdings.\n\nWhile the fascists never landed on the Coasts of Carthage nor ever replicated the salting, the Tunisian elites were wiser than to direct a conflict against the devil himself. As this terrible pact solidified through the past decades, to all astute observers, the present New Tyre is nothing more than a puppet under the whims of Rome's iron fist."

Like other traditional Berber territories, the French army began its occupation in the 19th century through diplomatic unification and military conquests of native African kingdoms encompassing these nomadic lands. During this period of being a part of the French colony, most Moors of the area remained pastoralists — but few congregation sites formed regardless due to a need for central governance and trading posts. Out of practicality and due to a lack of arable land, Néma's primary purpose was to act to herders as a pitstop rather than a self-subsisting township, which led to a structure resembling autonomous quarters over a cohesive administration.\n\nNéma's mainstay, as in many parts of the inhabited Azawad, is its status as the capital of an extensive slave trading network — a lucrative business that remains broadly practiced by the Arabic emirs and elites despite its illegality under the former French government. Currently, despite the West African debacle which has become a fact of life, the local nobility and chiefs choose to remain silent and neutral so long as their people continue to live uninfringed in their traditional way of life."

Monrovia is its Washington and the few places spared from the Luftwaffe's bombing runs in the region. Despite all the faults of the TWP administration, from its authoritarian practices to rampant corruption, the great project has undeniably grown far from the shanty town in which it began.\n\nBorn from the minds of prominent white Americans, Monrovia was a proposal that the American Colonization Society made in response to the perceived cultural issue of freed African slaves at the time. Most of those individuals viewed racial integration as inconceivable and adopted the consensus that freedmen must return to the African continent. This idea came to fruition in 1824 after ample preparation and patronage from President James Monroe, the city's namesake. Liberia sprung from 91 original colonizers, 88 of them black Americans.\n\nIn practice, however, this attempt at repatriation only migrated the issue of ethnic tension away from America. The Kru-speaking natives saw those men of the same skin as alien intruders — they saw men who spoke the language of foreigners and were as imperialistic as any others. Predictably, the American colonists, or the Americo-Liberians as known today, also ostracized the original inhabitants mutually. When the Constitution of 1847 created the legislative framework, Monrovia became the nation's capital, and so did those who sailed to the town become the masters.\n\nAlthough noticeably well-off for a West African state owing to American aid, Monrovia remains backward in its societal structure. For every extravagant palace and mansion in the metropolis, there are dozens of slums out of sight. Material wealth is a commodity for all men, but only some stay plentiful."

Selected for its proximity to established French ports, Niamey's population boomed during the 1920s after a protracted period of famines and droughts in rural areas, prompting many villagers to flood into the then-scantily populated town. Around the late 1930s, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, the government decided to commence with small-scale urban planning, which created a rough structure of population centers. Around the same time, France also bolstered its Catholic conversion program, which was ineffectual due to the Muslim majority opposing such an intentional effort.\n\nAs Paris fell to the grasp of Vichy's fascist ilk, the former control over the Sahara also weakened to irrelevance.

However, centuries before Germany's involvement in West Africa, Accra was already an abomination of European colonialism. Since the city's discovery by Danish navigators, who'd corrupted the name of Accra from the Guan word for the Ga people, Nkran, the interactions between Europeans and the Ghanaians were a one-sided manner of exchange.\n\nFrom the Dutchmen to the British hegemony, they called this place the "Gold Coast" for its famous abundance of gold. But for all the wealth that the toiling natives have produced, they never obtained the fruits of their labor. Since 1877, when Britain mandated Accra as the colonial capital, the city has been refitted and engineered to be of the most stratified and oppressive form for its Black citizens. For each ounce a laborer had in their pocket, there were tons stolen and stripped off to the wealthy communities in which the foreign officers indulge themselves.\n\nWhen Britain fell to the Kriegsmarine's forces, Accra felt no loss from their oppressors' departure. However, the Germanic hordes did not provide a welcoming entrance to the world of freedom.

Never a hospitable location for travelers, the Berber tribes of the region decided to carve out a trade route of their own along the eponymous city, which developed into a sultanate as its influence as a salt trading passage grew to encompass nearby lands. Its sparse population and central position in the Sahara made it a constant target of foreign kingdoms for a long time, from the Songhai to the Ottomans and eventually the French imperials. However, for the most part, Agadez was always independent in its operation. Traditionally led by a confederation of slaveholding ethnic chieftains, most regional powers that took over left the town an autonomous tributary.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Third French Republic, the nomads of the Aïr Mountains once again returned to pastoralism. Still following the tradition of kinship amongst their own, they are now free from the overlords that the land fell under for hundreds of years. What welcomed them, however, was not a taste of liberty — as the barren soils of the Sahara cannot survive without the burden of immense poverty. Agadez is barely sustained by trickling caravans nowadays, full of refugees across the desert and without a sustainable economy, the powderkeg is kept together by nothing but faith in the wise sultan."

What started as the possession of a playboy king transformed throughout the past decades from one oppressive hierarchy to another.\n\nBefore Leopoldville, the region was a collection of river settlements seized by the International Congo Society's expedition, led by Henry Stanley, to establish a transport headquarters for Leopold II's Congo Free State. Its position as an open port provided a stream of industry with abundant materials like rubber and ivory. This growth came at the cost of local tribes and villages, as well as the enslavement of many natives. Around 1910, during the transition from Leopold II's fiefdom to the Belgian colony of Congo, Leopoldville experienced an investment surge, elevating the trade hub to a planned city. The city's population and infrastructure grew to fit the status of capital, leading to its succession of Boma as the Governor General's seat in 1926.\n\nThroughout this history, Leopoldville was always a heavily stratified place where European settlers freely discriminated against and exploited African citizens, with an intentionally segregated design and forced labor sustaining the growth of extraction bases. Since the transition to German rule, life has become even more miserable as the Congo Lake abomination brought diseases and ecological damage to the city's vicinity. It has become clear that Müller's men are simply staying to strip the land of its remaining resources for the greed of mainland investors. Hope may still exist, but none remains in this wretched place."
 state_lore_desc.421_COG_IND: "The story of Leopoldville is one of tragedy and lingering idealism. While Müller's mercenary thugs no longer lord over the vicinity and the transitional administration has somewhat stabilized Congo, there is still much time until this torn nation and its rubble may recover.\n\nLeopoldville is free from its old oppressors, but as the German conglomerates that funded much of the nation's operations evacuated their facilities and the Zentralafrika garrison made its last stand, the city's foundations were burnt and demolished. The roads and ports that supported the Congo Lake's logistics have been reduced to rubble, and the bombing raids during the war rendered farming not viable in large swathes of the city and its surrounding areas. Despite the humanitarian efforts provided by OFN members to keep its population from starving, the Belgian and German projects that allowed Leopoldville's sustenance are permanently destroyed. In this chaotic state, many of the former slaves and workers scattered and left, leaving facilities and residences barren.\n\nThe remaining citizens of Leopoldville are attempting to make the best out of what was a metropolis, yet the Congo Lake's original pipelines are worn out from a lack of maintenance, and malaria outbreaks become a close reality. The outskirts, while less plagued by diseases, are not much better off with lingering German and Belgian insurgencies, which make a peaceful life impossible. From its outward appearance, everything remains as poverty-stricken and dilapidated as before. In a self-soothing manner, some say the road to decolonization is a steady and arduous process. Whether that's true remains uncertain, but for the time being, despite all that's gone and sacrificed, hope returns to this broken land."

Formerly a developing bureaucratic hub within the British African possessions, Hüttig transformed this place into the plaything of his cohort, a land of visions and opportunities built from bloodshed.\n\nLusaka's birth was the product of Rhodesia's early expansion of the state railway system, which brought many miners to the northern copper mining sites and led to the development of a settlement around the path's center as an access point and water station. While the early settlers were an assortment of Afrikaner farmers seeking work, the town's status grew more significant following the transfer of Northern Rhodesia to the Crown from the BSACo — which prompted the administration to designate the fledgling city as the new capital after deeming the southern Livingstone to be of poor communications and soundness.\n\nThe project to migrate all of Rhodes' infrastructure and systems to Lusaka proved to be a slow and sporadic process. Unprofitability and a lack of funding from London plagued the plan since its conception, compounded by high investor pullouts resulting in a reliance on loans. Despite these obstacles, for a short period around the Second World War, the region became temporarily revitalized by the surge of material extraction required for Britain's war production — but this pipe dream faded as the mainland forces fell to the German invaders.\n\nThe Lusaka earned by the Reich was a half-finished project that bore incomplete endeavors and many dreams — the same ones that will serve their new master to the dying breaths."

Still, among the marred Zambian landscape left for reconstruction, Lusaka became a dim reflection of an unrealized reality that neither the old occupiers nor any future generations may recreate.\n\nWith the infrastructure the British had built stripped and bombed into pitches of scorched earth from the many conflicts that occurred, the current Lusaka appears in a state that barely resembles the old Copperbelt hub colonial administrators took so pridefully upon. Citizens rest in huddled camps hastily constructed with the trinket materials received from humanitarian aid and benefactors, and those less fortunate might find themselves trapped in those working sites they toiled in for months. The railway system, the crown jewel of Northern Rhodesia, is rendered nothing but a vestigial remnant of an era when the city could prosper, even if under brutal, inhuman monsters.\n\nAs the physical damages appear severe, so are the spirits of those born and raised in this place. For a hundred years, the residents of Lusaka were an underclass — barely treated as fellow men, let alone given a chance to further themselves. The SS saw even a lesser concern for the affairs of those so-called inferiors than the Englishmen, leaving the present stewards of Lusaka condemned with not only a deficient environment but also without the means to adapt any better.\n\nNominally, the Zambian people are no longer slaves of European incursions, but the chains of poverty and destruction left in the name of those distant lands destined Lusaka to an intertwined state with a gilded past that rusted so distinctly."

But black gold permeated through every inch of the nation's soil, and the backward emirate of Abu Dhabi transformed the crown of the Arabian Gulf — and so did its capital turned into its jewel.\n\nThe current ruling creed of Abu Dhabi, or Land of the Gazelle, originated from a clan of Najdi settlers who had controlled the region since the 18th century. As they moved to occupy a part of the Gulf's tip through many conflicts, the house of Nahyan emerged as the most influential branch of the tribe while the northeastern Dubai region split away. The island city's development began in the 19th century after the emirate's consolidation — shaped by the British Empire's treaties and favors, which secured foreign trade in return for curbing piracy and development of resource extraction.\n\nUntil the 1920s, Abu Dhabi relied on seasonal pearl harvesting for its income, which became problematic due to the invention of cultured pearls and the depression after the First World War. The region was quite impoverished for some time, which prompted Britain to grant its first concession to the area in 1935 in hopes of locating oil as it did with other Persian states. This venture, however, was arduous at best, owing to the desert's terrain and low investment flow — and Mussolini inherited it in a half-finished shape.\n\nNot until the last decade were any significant reserves found, but after the first breakthrough in Umm Shaif, the Dhabyani elites began funneling more funding into constructing rigs and purifiers.

However, between the petty squabbles of the colonials — the rulership of Muscat always kept a mercantile mind, tipping between subjugation and isolation since time immemorial.\n\nThis trading game ended when Britain's influence grew uncontested in the Middle East by the late 19th century, with Oman's dream of independence buried by treaties and documents. Despite losing nominal autonomy, the Sultans of the Al Said dynasty retained firm control over Muscat and its surrounding cities, with the overlords from London being a hidden boon as they fended off tribal incursions in exchange for the geographical benefits of the strait. During this period, the city saw continued trade with the traditional partners of India and the Persians.\n\nFollowing the fall of the English mainland, the shadow over the Middle East dissipated almost immediately, and the Italians were eager to seize much of the Levant and the Gulf for their leisure.

In that time, Taipei floundered as just another backward port city, that was until foreign expansionism into the Chinese mainland by the British, the French and the Japanese would quickly paint a map of things to come for the fledgling Taiwanese city.\n\nThe strategic importance of Taipei to the Chinese informed the decision to name it the capital of Taiwan Province, followed by a program of rapid modernization. Yet inevitably, the fall of the Qing in the First Sino-Japanese War would see the island annexed into the Empire of Japan. Given its coastal proximity to the home islands, despite being far from the historic center of Taiwan and having a comparatively small IJA presence, the newly renamed Taihoku would become the seat of Japanese rule on the island.\n\nImmensely favored by the home islands following the annexation, Taihoku became the prototype of Japanese modernization. The city's water irrigation and sewer systems had been completed even before Tokyo's was, with the Japanese model of streetscape city planning for Taihoku becoming the blueprint for Tokyo's reconstruction after the 1923 Earthquake.\n\nManchukuo's frontier cities and Guangdong's bustling metropole might compete with each other for Tokyo's attention, but the people Taihoku, Hoklo and Japanese alike, are thoroughly convinced that Taihoku to be the most advanced, beautiful and superior city in all Asia, regardless of what mainland Japanese, continental Chinese, rural Taiwanese or native Formosans might think."

First went the name - though the characters remained, it was now called 'Heijo'. Then went the dirt roads, as Heijo became a railway hub connecting north to south and beyond. Buildings, power plants, waterways, electricity, everything a modern city needed (and the colonial administration required to maintain their rule). But the last thing to go - the culture of the people - persisted. It persisted through missionary efforts, through name changes, through language destruction, through the suppression of the May 1st movement. Korea clung stubbornly to her first city.\n\nThat light is slowly dimming. With most schoolchildren having been taught in Japanese their whole life, the urban population are beginning to forget their city's old name. In the year 1962, as cars trundle through the narrow streets adorned with signs in kanji and kana, and the night sky is pierced by modern, glass and concrete buildings striking from in between crowded apartments, the past blurs further and further beyond grasp."

Those walls were shattered in June of 1906 when the Japanese sought to remould the city for their purposes, and Kanko was born from her rubble - a vital artery of the Empire in the peninsula, connecting fertiliser factories, hydroelectricity plants, and port facilities to create one of the largest industrial clusters in Korea.\n\nSince the end of the war, Kanko has expanded further and further to feed the voracious appetite of the New Order in Asia, exploding in population and sprawl. Between the Seongchon River to the west and the Holyeon stream to the east, road networks bulldoze through the landscape in rigid grids, obliterating the historical urban centre and replacing them with monotonous blocks of dormitories and malls, more reminiscent of the New World than the Old. Despite this, the city continues to grow with rural migrants flocking desperately for a chance at the new life, and her overlords remain pleased."

 state_lore_desc.436: "Perth, often referred to as Australia’s most isolated capital, has long been a city shaped by its remoteness and connection to the vast Indian Ocean. Founded in 1829 as a British colony, Perth began as a modest outpost on the western frontier of the continent. Over time, it grew into a bustling hub for trade and commerce, its fortunes tied closely to the gold rushes of the late 19th century and the mineral wealth of Western Australia. By the mid-20th century, Perth had blossomed into a vibrant city, its skyline marked by a blend of modern skyscrapers and colonial-era buildings. The city’s port of Fremantle became a bustling center for shipping, fueling Perth’s economic growth and connecting the west coast to the rest of the world.\n\nAs Japan solidified its dominance in the Pacific and expanded its reach across Asia, Perth became the westernmost bastion of Australian defense, an alternative route away from the hostile eastern seas. Perth’s industries, once centered on mining and agriculture, partially shifted towards supporting the nation’s defense, and its isolation became both a strength and a vulnerability.\n\nNonetheless, the city framed by the Swan River and pristine beaches continued to thrive in the new global order. Sprawling suburbs and green parks provide a stark contrast to the bustling military activity on its coast. From Perth Town Hall to Kings Park, many centuries-old structures remain overlooking the city, undoubtedly steadfast symbols of Australia’s western frontier city."

Founded in 1836 as a free settlement rather than a convict colony, Adelaide’s early growth was driven by principles of civil liberty and religious freedom. From the wide, tree-lined streets to the grand colonial architecture, its planners envisioned a model city, a place where culture, industry, and community could thrive in harmony. Adelaide soon grew into an important agricultural and industrial center, its economy fueled by the surrounding farmland that produced some of the nation’s finest wine and grain.\n\nWhile a critical link in Australia’s domestic trade network, the city’s isolation from the Pacific has now become a source of safety, putting it on the backlines of a world in flux, with less vigilance around its areas compared to other major cities on the nation’s coast. In no small part thanks to that, Adelaide has managed to maintain and even bolster its unique charm.\n\nWide boulevards, public gardens, and elegant buildings continue to define Perth’s landscape, offering a sense of stability and tranquility amid global uncertainty. The city’s reputation as a cultural hub remains strong, with the recently inaugurated Adelaide Festival and Fringe continuing to draw artists and performers from across the free world. Adelaide stands as a rare respite amidst the ever wary nation, and a token of hope that one day all cities shall be as idyllic as the capital of South Australia."

Known for its wide boulevards, elegant Victorian architecture, and vibrant cultural scene, Melbourne became a beacon of sophistication in the young nation. A center for intellectual and artistic movements, its streets were lined with galleries, theaters, and cafes, and its urban landscape became a blend of grand historic buildings and modern skyscrapers.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, Melbourne, like the rest of Australia, found itself in a precarious position in the new global order. Despite its distance from the northern shores, the city became a critical center for strategic planning and military production. Factories that had once powered Australia’s economic boom were retooled to support defense initiatives. But Melbourne’s identity as a cultural powerhouse never wavered.\n\nEven in the face of uncertainty, the city’s arts scene flourishes, with its theaters, universities, and literary circles continuing to foster intellectual life.Numerous colonial-era landmarks—Flinders Street Station, the Royal Exhibition Building, and Parliament House—still stand as symbols of the city’s rich history. Meanwhile, its sprawling suburbs and vibrant city center have continued to evolve, blending past and present. Melbourne has held firm to its identity as the cultural capital, a place where industry, intellect, and creativity all converge."

Its meticulously planned streets, lined with government buildings, lush parks, and monuments to Australia’s past, reflect a city built with the future in mind. The Parliament House, perched atop Capital Hill, stands tall as a testament to the young nation’s aspirations of good governance and unity, still echoing ever since its federation decades ago.\n\nIn the new world order, however, Canberra’s peaceful image now conceals the tensions lurking beneath the surface. Though still a hub for political and cultural life, the city has been forced to adapt to the realities of a drastically altered global stage. Japan’s dominance over the Pacific casts a long shadow, though the immediate threat feels distant for now. Government officials remain on high alert, constantly assessing the balance of power in the region while striving to protect Australia’s precarious position.\n\nLife in Canberra goes on much as before, with its universities producing the next generation of scholars and its bureaucratic machine continuing to function. The Japanese threat may linger in the background, but the city’s enduring resilience defines its story as much as the challenges that surround it."

Its subtropical climate and location along the Brisbane River made it a key hub for the surrounding region’s sugarcane and cattle industries, while its port connected Queensland to the broader Pacific and beyond. Brisbane soon developed a reputation as a city on the rise, full of opportunity and driven by its resource-rich hinterland. Yet, it remained something of a frontier city—its relative isolation from the more developed southern capitals gave it a unique independence and character.\n\nServing as the headquarters for the ultimately doomed campaign of General Douglas MacArthur left behind a lingering legacy in the city's consciousness. As Japan’s tentacles spread across the Pacific, Brisbane’s proximity to the contested northern waters made it a critical defensive outpost for Australia. The city’s port and factories shifted into high gear, becoming key suppliers of military goods and naval support for the nation’s continued defense.\n\nDespite the uncertainties of the postwar world, the city's population continues to grow, its vibrant neighborhoods and sunny beaches attracting people from across the country. The city’s subtropical lifestyle—its alfresco dining, laid-back attitude, and outdoor recreational opportunities—have created a distinctive atmosphere mixing hard work with the enjoyment of Queensland’s natural beauty. Brisbane’s frontier spirit, forged in its earliest days, continues to define its character, ensuring that no matter the challenges, the city will endure and thrive."

As he died, marred by disease, a succession crisis within the Incan Empire divided and sapped any chance of resisting the oncoming Spanish Empire. Quito was slowly built, starting with its chapel in 1534, the local population converted and enslaved as local leaders were captured and executed for resisting Spanish rule.\n\nAfter this, the catastrophe dissipated into history. Declared a city in 1541, the locality continued to develop over the next few centuries, being ceded in 1717 from Peru to New Granada. A pair of revolts in 1765 and 1809 briefly formed independent governments around the city, and provided the basis for an independent Ecuadorian state to be established, finally removed from Spanish control by the Free Province of Guayaquil.\n\nToday, Quito faces catastrophe once more. With a stagnating economy worsened by a number of military coups and disastrous efforts to align with the Triumvirate, numerous defeats in military conflicts against Peru has led to a final humiliation, a puppet government being installed. Countless refugees left for Colombia, but political instability has forced them back south, into shanty towns and hastily erected refugee camps. With its leadership rudderless, a comfortable horizon does not seem to be in Quito's future."

While never a glimmering emerald such as Tangier or Tunis, remaining tolerable in the African malady is a feat underestimated.\n\nFrom a fiefdom under Bambara rule, a prototypical confederation of small settlements upon the river, Bamako was not a remarkable place until the French expedition towards the Niger, where the administrator of Upper Senegal laid fortifications and sieged upon this minute chiefdom for two months. In a flaccid proportion, this led to its swift surrender and the establishment of French Soudan, a colonial expansion carved through sweeping hegemony upon commercial domination of the region.\n\nBamako's flat terrain and rolling currents delivered an administrative paradise for the bureaucrats who ruled the oppressive Malian territory for the subsequent half-century. Francophone officials and a few assimilated elites ruled in the vein of bringing modernity and civilization, a confounding contradiction to the thousands who slaved away in plantations and mines. This absolute paradox that a monopoly of violence kept afloat was a rather stubborn apparatus, both by the industrial progress brought and the populations shepherded, one only broken apart after the sordid collapse of Free France.\n\nAlthough the disgraceful holdout residing in the Ivory Coast presently has no say in the affairs of the Sahel, the current Mali state remains under the governance of the same despotism as before — heartless oppression perpetrated not by men but by the barren and volatile material conditions themselves, singing a self-righteous lullaby in the name of the future."

Whether it be the bustling ports or the most diminutive of plantations, the lagoon-city is a sanctuary for all the Yoruba peoples wishing to thrive in the Sahel savanna.\n\nLagos has always been West Africa's link to the European continent. Its involvement in the transatlantic slave trade as a city-state made a prosperous naval base attractive to British merchants. In 1851, following the popular will of emancipated Creoles and urging from the deposed chief of Lagos, Britain bombarded the town's shores for two months before signing a capitulation treaty that consolidated the British foothold in modern Yorubaland.\n\nWhile the Oba once again ascended to his throne, Lagos became yet another colony of the vast territories under Anglo rule, which was, for a period, governed by the Ghanaian garrison. The harbor's resurgence of significance did not arrive until 1900, when Frederick Lugard merged the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria with the Lagos Colony, naming the fledgling metropolis, which benefited from its palm oil production and fisheries, as the state's capital.\n\nFollowing its newfound status, the development of the Lagos Government Railway brought significant modernization to the area along with its complementary projects. However, the liberty of its inhabitants never seemed the priority of colonial administrators, becoming a forgotten issue before the collapse of the British Empire. With unprecedented autonomy came challenges of poverty and management unforeseen — Yoruba's lifeblood is under the sway of no other entities but its own will."

The decaying birthplace of Pan-Africanism appears as a speck bordering Germany's hinterland possessions, yet the most potent of will. While Sudwestafrika's bombing raids wore down the terrains of Cameroun, for each settlement napalmed, the spirit of freedom and socialism reignited ever more ferociously.\n\nAs yet another victim of colonialism, Douala's story is prevalent as fleas in the Dark Continent — first subjected by the Germans under a protectorate, which the local chiefs became entrapped in by coercion for close to half a century. When the Second Reich's continental ambition failed on a disappointing note of destruction after Versaille, the Frenchmen substituted in the most direly sought-after role of an indifferent oppressor, an enforcer of the mandate's paternalistic task to establish Western businesses in this amalgamated town of many villages subsumed.\n\nLike a domino set that never subsided in velocity, the Francophone empire also fell with an equal measure of humiliation following de Gaulle's folly, which perished with London’s occupation. Despite best efforts to retain a foothold unmolested by the Vichy cohort, national liberation forces that emerged amid Western Africa's anarchy leveled the colossus at last — in a shape practiced by Douala's preeminent intellectuals and meshed into a movement sustained by a united front, something never meant to last.\n\nThe collapse continued as expected, even with Cameroon and Douala held in the good hands of democratic principles. A capital barely recognizable as an intact village added little to the legitimacy of the free government. With all sides surrounded by a variety of European predators — capitulationism is a simple but damning option for all those invested in this great revolutionary project."

 state_lore_desc.446_GER: "Windhoek is a quintessentially German city among all the disparate possessions the Nazis tied together from former British and French colonies. Settled by Lutherans and Cape Africans, it is the historical stronghold of Teutonic influences upon the Dark Continent.\n\nNamed after the Winterhoek of the Western Cape, the city was born a frontier town developed by Orlam tribe outlaws who fled from South Africa in the 1840s. Coincidentally, Rhenish missionaries started preaching around the area since its conception. In examination, the early relationships between the Germans and the Nama migrants appeared cordial until the settlement became barren shortly after several tribal conflicts.\n\nWindhoek only began reconstruction under the request of Lüderitz colonial merchants in 1890 as it became a centerpiece between the boundaries of the warring Nama and Herero peoples. Since the Reich drew a border for the colony of Sudwestafrika in 1884, this new capital of the Namib concentrated on extracting the wealth of the southern African soil. In the following years before the First World War, indigenous peoples also began flocking to the city for work as intertribal conflicts cooled.\n\nAfter the seizure of German colonies following the Treaty of Versailles, Ebert and Hindenburg did not forfeit the claim to this ebony jewel. In an unexpected turn of events, the pipe dream proved more than delusion — when the British fell following the Second World War, Windhoek returned to Germania's hands. Today, jets and booming machinery ring across the born-again metropolis — as an eternal cheer to the reestablished Reichkommisariat's industry and exploitation."
 state_lore_desc.446_SAF: "The Germans juggled and plotted for so long to once again swallow southern Africa with its grim purposes — the Schild was the apex of this fascist insanity, an unfortunate monstrosity put down by the collective will of the Free World. The mandate of South West Africa's abolishment was the gravest insult to the British foothold in the Dark Continent. However, with it once again under the old order — this time, the mistakes of the past will not repeat, Windhoek will be recognizably South African, and the native landscape shall heal under the guidance of their saviors.\n\nWindhoek became barren after the evacuation of German contractors and capital. Nothing more than a litter of impoverished citizens and rugged gravel remains in this scarce landscape. In an attempt to keep this regional administrative center functional, the South African regime relied extensively upon the humanitarian assistance of the American government, both to contain the anarchy that the city transformed into and to keep its inhabitants from starvation. Consequently, the perimeters of the metropolis appear more as if slums constructed from foreign materials than proper settlements — a shape more reminiscent of abject poverty than even the worst of Germany's excesses.\n\nThe Namib is a place capable of birthing resilience, no matter how long this 'provisional rule' may last. The residents of Windhoek remain aware in their hearts that they've managed to endure German colonialism for so long — the paternalist Anglos are a trial that they merely must endure again, a phase that may provide them the constitution to survive the future."
 state_lore_desc.446_IND: "Sudwestafrika was not the Congo or Huttig's abomination — this 'milder' regime appears merely as a continuation of a previously established German holding, a product of an antiquated time. But for the people of Namibia, they'd found the lesser of fascistic rule little better than abject poverty and slavery. The national capital of Windhoek presently lies in its barest and ugliest shape, stripped of its deafening hums and chants — a barren and tired place, drained of its energy from years of oppression.\n\nWhat Schenck left behind was not a piece of ruined and drowned land as the other occupied colonies transformed into — instead, the skies of Windhoek became a quiet place, without riots, without unrest, but also any ambitions. The people grew healthier and wealthier without the Germanic bandits robbing their fortunes, but what industries and resources valuable were nowhere within this newborn state. The Krupps and the Flicks have no intention of staying in a land where they'd no longer be able to exploit and be torn asunder just not long ago. This metropolis of South West Africa is a landscape of bombed huts, rusted machinery, and an abandoned pinnacle of the oppressive labyrinth that German capitalists saw as their playground.\n\nThe story's previous chapter ended with a note of catastrophe, but a new government, free of its slavers, was born from these rubbles — still stratified and poor, but something which the Namibian people can call home. While Windhoek is a lost cause in trying to replicate what was concluded, from its ashes, perhaps something better, something not a mistake from its conception, may be born anew."

The north of the region first served as a Buddhist monastery, birthing Newar Buddhism as Shakya refugees settled in the region. A number of settlements were founded in the location, with some of the earliest villages unified under Gunakamadeva, thus forming, if only in small scale, the modern city of Kathmandu.\n\nFrom there, Kathmandu became a major centre for trade and travel, serving as a connecting sinew between China and India and serving as a centre for art. During the thirteenth century, a mixture of earthquakes and attacks harmed, but did not destroy its previous hegemony, slowly integrating more cities across its valley. Kathmandu became the capital of the Gorkha Empire as it conquered Nepal, seeing significant military development as constant war led to its economy stagnating. After being forced into numerous concessions to the British, Kathmandu's economy struggled further under the Rana through isolation, and was further hampered by an earthquake in 1934.\n\nYet still, Kathmandu remains as the central settlement within Nepal. It still serves as the path for numerous trade routes.  The city has mostly recovered from the earthquake, and is slowly undergoing a renovation of its older infrastructure. The monarchy has reasserted its dominance over the Rana, now subsuming the country's multi-party democracy, but its efforts to restore diplomatic ties with India has thrown the city into the heart of the power struggle between Bose and Nehru.

From here, Srivijayan monarchs forged their domain of rice and water; from here, the Indonesian national identity began its formation in incubation. When the first oil refineries sprung up like palm trees around the eternal city, it seemed as if the roofs began to glisten once more, the sceptres of power returned, an aura of rejuvenated splendour unmatched since the era of maritime prowess. However, the sceptre's strength was now embodied by the churning of wells and machines, the highrises of concrete and steel, the torrent of human bodies submerged in inexorable monotony.

Even by Antarctic standards, the Island is a miserable, wretched place.\n\nThe worst cut of meat from Argentina's Antarctic bounty was tossed to the Italians, cold and wet with endless rain buzzing through the sky like carrion flies, and sharp rocks digging into its shores like maggots. The abandoned waterlogged ruins of previous Argentine settlement stand as an eternal testament to the undesirability of this locale.\n\nIn Galindez, the sun seems to only emerge in the dreams of its residents as they shiver in their makeshift tents. A few old and worn ships stand vigil in the harbor for these unfortunate souls, bobbing in the wind-swept sea.\n\nTo the politicians back home the establishment of the base seemed like a testament to the prestige of their new imperium, but to those who have to man this distant outpost, there is no glory to be found here, only pneumonia and mud."

 state_lore_desc.991: "In the isolated base of Ruperto Elichiribehety Antarctic Scientific Station, naive ambition has met cold hard reality. Isolated kilometers inland surrounded by barren wasteland, on the very frontier of the Nazi empire, the hopes and enthusiasm of the initial expedition slowly calcify into despair. A thin umbilical-esque supply line to the coast serves as the only connection these desperate souls have to the warmth of the outside world, keeping the dozens of occupants of the encampment stocked with just enough food and fuel to maintain the embers of life.\n\nNo one, not even their quixotic leader Dr. Musso believes their meager defenses and limited supplies would hold up to a Nazi counterattack or any other danger this dark land might hold. They have neither the ammunition to fight back nor snow shoes to mount a full retreat through the ice. The desperate requests for OFN resupply are left perpetually unresolved. And yet despite everything the residents of the base try to go about their daily lives as best they can performing scientific experiments, geological surveys, and shoring up defenses as the blackness beyond slips ever closer."

Dozens of barely serviceable tents flap in the chill winds behind a perimeter of trench networks, its marine occupants caught in an eternal miserable cycle of sleep and patrol. These poor soldiers face a very different fight than they were expecting or prepared for. Their vast supplies of materiel do little to combat the true enemy in these lands, the continent itself.\n\nBullets and shells are mere sticks and stones against frostbite and pneumonia. In the distance beyond the chunks of heaving ice and freezing waters, the true heart of the Brazilian expedition looms. The Minais Gerais aircraft carrier and its commander Admiral Rademaker watch its underlings from afar, with only limited helicopter contact ferrying increasingly harsh orders and dwindling supplies. Like an Old Testament God surveying its miserable flock as they scramble to serve its every whim, the metal behemoth lies in wait for the battles to come and new lands to conquer."

 state_lore_desc.993: "Artigas Base is a land of dreams and hope. Dr. Musso has always dreamed of asserting the Uruguayan claim to Antarctica but his hopes were dashed by the Scramble for Antarctica that occurred in the wake of the Snipe Incident. Now that his ambitions have finally been achieved Musso seems intent on recreating a time that never existed, an age of discovery greedily snatched away from him after the preliminary expedition of 1954. Its habitats look less like a fortress on the bleeding edge of Nazi terror, but instead, a civilian base of the 1950s perfectly suited for scientific inquiry and whatever can approach comfortable living in these lands.\n\nAs Musso lives out his lost life as an Antarctic explorer, his military attache and OFN advisors plead and beg with him to do more to prepare for the seemingly inevitable Nazi counterattack, to bring in more guns, to station more men. Whether due to resentment of the Americans, or a forlorn hope that resisting militarization might keep the Germans away, Dr. Musso continues to prevericate on the issue of OFN reenforcement. However, even Musso questions how long this quiet will last. Will the Germanic horde tear through the snows and once again turn this land of dreams into a realm of nightmares?"

 state_lore_desc.994: "During the evacuation of the German Antarctic colonies in Neuschwabenland, a cadre of the Reich's most "accomplished" minds were discreetly funneled into a new base on the Kiss Ice Shelf. Its name: Begerheim. Named after the intrepid Aryan explorer, Bruno Beger, this Ahnenerbe stronghold was tasked with finding evidence to support a number of fundamental scientific theories.\n\nThe population of Begerheim is small compared to other Antarctic claims: two-hundred and fifty souls, split between Ahnenerbe scientists and a detachment of Waffen-SS security personnel. It operates a heliport for archaeological sorties and a hidden submarine bay through which Burgundy and the Reichsführer-SS himself maintain contact with the base and ensure crucial supply deliveries.\n\nBegerheim is nominally a part of the German claim of Neuschwabenland, however contact between the two organizations is sparse and often unfriendly, especially in the wake of the attempted SS coup in the Fatherland. How long this uneasy coexistence will last is anyone's guess. The Ahnenerbe conduct themselves with extreme secrecy. Information about the internal goings-on of Begerheim rarely leaves the stronghold's walls. When it does, the world trembles."

 state_lore_name.995: "Shōwa Station"
 state_lore_desc.995: "Shōwa Station is emblematic of the depths of cynical power politics that fueled the Scramble for Antarctica. Situated in perhaps the most hostile coastal region on the continent the former Marie Byrd Land, the base serves little purpose beyond legitimizing the Japanese claim to the area, a fact that its residents are reminded of daily. With a harbor nearly constantly covered in dense ice, supply convoys are rare, and its residents operate with bare minimum necessities. Despite being under the nominal command of the IJN's Antarctic Task Force, based thousands of miles away on the Gilbert Islands, the base is of negligible military value and is treated as such. A few token soldiers perform routine patrols more out of boredom than necessity, while the base's defenses are left to rot. Bureaucrats, workers, and the occasional scientist of the Imperial Polar Research Institute perform equally menial tasks carrying on the pantomime of a functioning Antarctic base.\n\nIn recent years the Navy has offloaded many of the tasks of day-to-day management to the Nissui fishing conglomerate, who use Shōwa Station to legitimate their exclusive claim to fish and whale in these waters. Supplies seem to come more often from Nissui shipping vessels than naval convoys these days as the creeping chill of privatization moves ever closer. Nissui is also responsible for one of the few notable changes to the local landscape: a vast graveyard of whale bones, accompanied by various macabre devices once used to process the leviathans for oil and meat. This slaughterhouse is rarely used nowadays, but the gruesome display serves as a perpetual reminder to the residents of Shōwa Station of where their fate might lie should things take a turn for the worse."

It was for this purpose that Esperanza Base was built. It came to be the foundation of Argentine power projection in the region and ensured their influence extended far enough to establish firm sovereignty over their Antarctic claim.\n\nEsperanza is now one of the most multifaceted bases on the continent. It serves as a naval port, a military outpost, and an administrative complex for Argentinean Antarctica and Argentina itself. The military aspect of Esperanza is particularly accentuated today, as the Argentine military uses the base to expand its power and seek its own ends..."

Its power projection was an important factor in Chile emerging from the Scramble with a firmly established claim and the base allowed the navy to defend Greenwich Island itself during the tensest moments of Chilean-Argentine disputes.\n\nIndeed, the base was central to the defense the Chileans staged during the Snipe War. Prat Base was fortified enough to ward off any potential Argentine aggression, even as nearby areas fell.\n\nTechnically a naval base able to support a handful of ships, Prat is a critical post for the Chilean Navy to counter future Argentinean posturing, should circumstances require..."

McMurdo Station is the largest base on the Antarctic continent, populated by up 1,500 people in the height of summer, boasts a sizable port, and is serviced by nearby Williams Field for aerial transportation.\n\nThis behemoth of the Antarctic Wastes sits in the Ross Dependency of Antarctica, a region inside New Zealand's claim, but is administered by the USA's Antarctic Development Command. It was built on the volcanic Ross Island during the first Operation Deep Freeze, which took place in the midst of the Scramble.\n\nOf its many quirks, the most unique is its nuclear power station, created to solve fuel issues at the base. While it provides a substantial amount of power and reduces the need for fuel, it remains an unknown in the emerging field of nuclear power, one that could have devastating consequences."

 state_lore_desc.999: "The German Empire stretches across much of the world, and at its very edge Schirmacher Station stands defiant against the desolation of Antarctica. The base is built in an Antarctic oasis that was discovered and named by Richardheinrich Schirmacher during the 3rd German Antarctic Expedition. These oases are patches of land naturally free of snow and ice, which, along with the oasis' easy access to freshwater lakes and vast 25 km long and 3 km wide size, made it an advantageous location for settlement during the Scramble for Antarctica.\n\nSchirmacher Station was initially created as the military counterpart to the colonial effort started by Germany on the frigid continent. However, the plan for long-term and expansive settlement proved to be out of human reach, and Schirmacher now looms over the abandoned colonial site.\n\nThe station houses about 500 people maximum. This creates the need for the interdependence Schirmacher Station shares with its neighboring bases, which house around the same number of people but rely on Schirmacher's greater stores of rations and supplies to sustain themselves. Along with this relationship, Schirmacher also lacks a seaport and airfield. Instead it uses the nearby Admiral Graf Spee Harbor and an experimental aircraft testing base."
