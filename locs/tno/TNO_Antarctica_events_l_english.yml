 antarctica_aaa_alert_event.10.t:0 "The Proud Sergeant"
 antarctica_aaa_alert_event.10.desc:0 "Sergeant Tancredo Lopez could usually take pride in two things; his nation's army and his men. But as his squad waited on the outskirts of the Chilean base "General Bernardo O'Higgins", he wondered if his pride was misplaced. The first thing that was immediately obvious was the age of the weapons the quartermaster gave them, with the young Private Ortega wielding a Mauser that would be better described as a museum piece, and their ammo was scarce and of poor quality. On top of that the rations were in such bad condition that they had to divert time in order to hunt some penguins for food.\n\nLopez's men were currently seated around a fire cooking the penguin meat, and they had started to grumble.\n\n"Why the hell are we even here? Do the idiot politicians back home really care about this wasteland?" said Corporal Diaz.\n\nPvt. Ortega, rusted Mauser in his hands, sat across the fire and snapped at him, "Are you serious? We are soldiers who are tasked to protect our great nation's honor from those Chilean bastards." He sounded youthful and passionate compared to the other men's cynicism.\n\n"Kid, if there was something out there besides snow, I'd run away if it meant the chance at a decent meal," Diaz got some sounds of approval from the other men but before the Ortega could say anything, Lopez jumped in, "Rodriguez, you're lucky we've only got a magazine each or I'd shoot you with no hesitation for such talk." Diaz sunk in his chair while shooting the Sergeant a look that could kill. As the night wore on and the men went to sleep, Sergeant Lopez stayed awake.\n\nThe next morning Lopez and his men watched Chilean soldiers start to approach, their camp wrapped up in their thick gray coats and carrying new M-14s courtesy of Uncle Sam. "Fall back!" Lopez barked out.\n\n"B-but sir, with our bravery I'm sure we cou-" Pvt. Ortega started before the Sergeant gave him a cold glance, he quickly gave up on whatever he was about to say as he followed the others back to their snowcats. They arrived in Esperanza with a sense of shame, none as great as Sergeant Lopez."

 antarctica_aaa_alert_event.11.desc:0 "The cold, slimy meat slipped through Matteo's teeth for only a moment before he ejected it into the sea below. Spoiled rations again. Matteo didn't know how canned beef could go bad in the perpetual outdoor refrigerator of the Antarctic, truly the incompetence of the Institute knew no bounds.\n\nIn all his years of service prior to reassignment to the South, Matteo had always seen the navy as a bastion of discipline and order, holding back the excesses of the effete civilian bureaucrats and politicians. His recent experiences had dispelled such notions. Argentina's bid for Antarctic dominance was supposed to be a national triumph, a revival of the conquering spirit that had tamed the Pampas so long ago. No, instead blood and treasure was spent on the quixotic whims of their explorer-in-chief searching the rectum of the continent all while foreign powers ran roughshod over their claims.\n\nNo, the rot did not lie exclusively in the civilians, it was rooted much deeper than that. Suddenly, Matteo' musings were interrupted by commands: ships had been spotted in the vicinity. At first Matteo felt more frustration: they were supposed to be the only vessels in this region. Were his commanders so incompetent that they would waste precious fuel on redundant convoys? With the captain's next pronunciation, frustrations were replaced by fear. These were Chilean ships, in Argentine waters.\n\nA loud boom ripped through the air, and he glimpsed the light of cannons in the distance. Were they warning shots, or were the Chileans really so bold as to fire on an Argentine vessel? His captain did not take the time to find out, and soon enough the ship had turned back the way it had come. If the Argentine navy was too cowardly and ineffectual that it couldn't even patrol its own waters, things were truly finished. With that thought, Matteo threw his rotten meat can at the distant Chilean vessel and returned to his cabin, turning his back on the icy wastes."

 antarctica_aaa_alert_event.20.desc:0 ""No, I won't be calm about this!" shouted Beltramino over the phone, "What do you mean it's just a map!? Just use your eyes goddamnit! Look, this ridiculous fucking parody of a map shows Chile owning nearly the entire Antarctic Peninsula!" He listened a bit more to the Argentine diplomat on the phone, growing increasingly irate as he did so.\n\n"Why's that an issue? What the Chileans say doesn't matter?"\n\n"What do you think happens when those maps start getting used by the American media? Or their politicians. Or their military. This map is 'wrong' now, but it won't be wrong forever if the Americans take action over it. The whole world's acting like we're just squatters on Chile's land! I won't stand for it! This land is as inseparably Argentine as Buenos Aires itself!"\n\nHe sighed, "Colonel Leal will have his work cut out for him cleaning up this mess, we need to seriously increase our international legitimacy, and fast."\n\nAs he hung up the phone he said, "Just... make sure this doesn't happen again. The cartographer's pen stroke can cause a war as easily as a bullet.""

 antarctica_aaa_alert_event.30.t:0 "For Want of Supplies"
 antarctica_aaa_alert_event.30.desc:0 "Lieutenant Jose Madeira looked through his binoculars at the quickly approaching storm clouds, if he had to guess the base was about to be hammered by a blizzard soon. Although, to describe this place as a 'base' was being charitable, as he looked around him and saw his men tearing it apart for every last possible bit of food and fuel before shoving it into their snowcats.\n\nThey were running too low on supplies to continue this facility's existence, and they weren't the only ones. Many bases throughout the territory had been abandoned recently due to issues with logistics.\n\nHe sighed as he looked around him, their orange coats and vehicles bright specks in a seemingly endless wasteland of white. He turned his attention to the flag which marked the border of the camp, its bright blue bands contrasting against the slowly encroaching black clouds, the white center that mirrored the landscape around him and the sun, which he missed dearly in this desolate tundra.\n\n"Was this all worth it?" He thought to himself. While Jose was a patriotic soldier he couldn't help but think that out of all the ways to expand his nation's borders and earn prestige. There were plenty that didn't involve earning frostbite and starving at the bottom of the world, right?\n\nHe snapped out of his fugue when he heard the crunch of boots approaching him, spinning on his heels he came face to face with Dr. Lucas T. Crespo, a glaciologist who he had come to appreciate over the past couple of lonely months. "The data we've gathered from here has been good, a shame we've stretched ourselves too thin to gain anything meaningful," he said glumly. Jose scoffed in response.\n\n"You don't have to tell me twice, blame Leal and that pet project of his to reach the fucking pole." A fierce gust of wind silenced both men, as both turned to finish packing."

 antarctica_aac_alert_event.10.t:0 "Red in the Face"
 antarctica_aac_alert_event.10.desc:0 "Merino slammed the latrine door and began to pace. He couldn't stand another minute of this briefing. He always knew that slimy two bit Machiavelli, Guzman was nothing more than a piss-sweet talking con artist, but he didn't expect him to be a moron to boot. The reports were worse than ever, the ape shaped worms from Buenos Aires were expanding with every passing day dropping their ugly flags across Chilean territory like bird shit. There was a solution to this infestation, one Merino had known since day one, extermination.\n\nBut no, Guzman and his lame-brained cronies were calling the shots and still thought they could talk their way out of this situation, as if the Argentines were capable of anything resembling human speech. All while their supplies ran dry and those worm-apes frolicked through Chilean territory. In the old days, people as simple as Guzman would've been sterilized much less gain any degree of political relevance. It didn't make sense, unless… of course it was that red communist snake Jaksic. He did not know what that man-thing would gain from selling out to the Argentines, perhaps like all feeble limp-wrist reds he was jealous of the power of a people who were proud of their own strength. Never mind that for now, Merino wouldn't let this territory fall, he had a plan. The first step would be imposing rations, and with the fat slobs here at base having no more extra meals to gorge on, he would have them in uniform and patrolling the lines. Still the territory was on the precipice, another wrong step and the Argentines would be storming through the door and if that happened Jaksic wouldn't have time to join his comrades, no Merino would find him first and when he did..."

 antarctica_aac_alert_event.11.t:0 "It Ends in Fire"
 antarctica_aac_alert_event.11.desc: "The cabinet plummeted down with a metallic thud. Professor Guzmán picked up the few remaining scattered papers, looked back at his desk, at his office, at the map of Chilean Antarctica, and closed the door. For the last time, he supposed. The stovetop in the adjoining room burned, fed by a large mound of papers. Guzmán tossed his documents, maps, telegrams, and all other materials into the flames.\n\nHe walked out to see men scurrying all around Arturo Prat's burning buildings. Red and orange lit every window. Smoke columns spewed into the sky. Some men hauled the few remaining possessions and supplies they'd leave the base with, and others brought more papers to burn. It was the end. The same end that had met Base Bernardo O'Higgins, evacuated due to a chronic supply shortage. The same end that met multiple Chilean islands across the Antarctic coast, seized by the Argentine navy.\n\nAnd while Argentina conquered from the sea, frantic broadcasts took the airwaves in the communications room. Bases on Costa Rafael Sotomayor reported sightings of Japanese troops. Guzmán walked past the chaos only with two suitcases. Alone.\n\nJaksic, Villaroel and Miranda were all in Punta Arenas trying to coordinate the evacuation. And Merino? Guzmán scoffed. Some said he had taken his cruiser for a last stand against the Argentines. It was just as likely he had taken the first ticket home.\n\nThe last plane came to life on the icy runway. Guzmán entered the cabin, surrounded by the last Chileans in Antarctica. Tired men, their dreams broken by a world where might, only might, was right. Arturo Prat was only a hazy shadow engulfed in burning red. Guzmán looked at it, and saw this chapter of Chile's history coming to a close. A chapter in his life closed too."

 antarctica_aac_alert_event.20.t:0 "Imposter Syndrome"
 antarctica_aac_alert_event.20.desc:0 "Professor Guzman slumped into the soft cushion of his chair as he stared out the window into the Antarctic abyss. His office was filled with scattered papers and a few empty bottles. A half-eaten lunch, long since gone cold, sat neglected on his desk.\n\nHe hadn't moved from his spot in over an hour, it felt like an eternity.\n\nHe had been opening letter after letter from Villarroel and Miranda, and they were all saying the same thing. All across Latin America, there were whispers. People saying that Argentina clearly had the upper hand. People saying that Argentina really did have the right to the territory it said it did. Chile's Antarctic operations, in the eyes of the world, were a joke. A simple holdout, in denial about how irrelevant they really were.\n\nBut he knew the truth. In the end, it was he who bore the greatest responsibility for this. His nation had given him this position because it was believed that he could be the one to restore their position in Antarctica, and give them the respect that they deserved from the world. And here it was, proof that they had all been mistaken, that the man they chose to lead them was nothing but an imposter, playing at diplomacy.\n\nThere will soon come a time when Guzman refuses to let this setback deter him. A time will come when he bounces back with more fervor than ever before, to stand up for justice and rule of law in defiance of a world gone mad. A time when the people here have the leader they deserve..."

 antarctica_aac_alert_event.30.desc: "The captain moved aside with a sleazy and toothy grin. \"The supplies are this way gentlemen, if you care to follow me?\" Jaksic smiled and clicked his ballpoint pen as he walked into the awaiting darkness\n\n\"Gladly sir, I'm sure everything is in order.\" However, as Jaksic and his team continued to fill out their clipboards there was a growing sense of unease. It was no secret that the Antarctic territories had a massive turnover in supplies and that there were discrepancies between what was on paper, and what currently sat in the hold. Sure it started small; 10 crates of snow shoes instead of 11, 15 weeks worth of hardtack instead of the promised 17. But it quickly became clear that something was amiss, just like the hold, the situation with the supplies was shrouded in darkness. Jaksic tapped the side of one of the oil drums, the hollowness echoing throughout the hold, everyone stood as still as mannequins as he turned to the ship's captain with a grave seriousness. \"Now sir, you know the Chilean government ordered 150 gallons of oil for its Antarctic territories, do you care to tell me how many gallons actually sit in this hold?\" He said with an icy chill in his voice, the only noise being the creaking of the cargo ship as the captain's stoic facade started to crack.\n\n\"M-mr Jaksic, I'd have t-to check with my first mate but I think we currently hold...umm...83 or 84 gallons...give or take.\" He finally admitted, the sweat glistening in the low light as the inspection team realized they had been ripped off. Jaksic could've exploded then and there in the captain's face, ready to tell him off for how he was willing to endanger or even indirectly kill dozens of brave Chileans, and for what? A couple thousand peso skimmed off the top! Jaksic swallowed his bile as he felt a headache start to form, numbers swimming in his head."

 antarctica_aag_alert_event.10.t:0 "The Border" # AAG No Mil
 antarctica_aag_alert_event.10.desc:0 "The last sporadic gunshots echoed through the valley, and then all was silent. Herbert Freitag, knees aching, stood up from his position of cover. He lifted a pair of binoculars to his eyes. Down the valley, he could see the American soldiers retreating on snowmobiles and snow tractors. He looked over his own squad. Two men were dead. Everyone else had sustained some form of injury, and they were, to a man, out of ammo.\n\nFreitag had no clue what the brass was thinking; they hadn't allocated nearly enough heavy weapons to his outpost, which stood on the border of the OAA. Their position was indefensible. It was a minor miracle he'd fended off this latest attack. Another, and his men might not be so lucky.\n\nFreitag went to their radio operator inside the nearby field habitat. "I want you to send this message back to Mayr," he said. "'American units launching probing attacks on border. Request immediate fire support from heavy weapons teams. Position increasingly untenable.'"\n\nFreitag hoped Mayr would heed the message. He seemed a sensible man. For now, however, all that was left was to keep eyes on the border and hope the Americans didn't come back.\n\nAt Schirmacher Station, an exhausted Mayr was pulled from his bed by an emergency communique from one of their border stations. He read the message and sighed. "Another one?" he said.\n\nAnton Grasser nodded. "Seems the bastards have noticed our lack of patrols lately. We need to send a message, and soon.""
 antarctica_aag_alert_event.10.a:0 ""Agreed," said Mayr. "Deploy reserve units to the frontline.""

 antarctica_aag_alert_event.11.desc:0 "Freitag pushed the engine of his snow tractor to its limit. He knew he risked a burnout, but he had to make it back to Schirmacher Station and convey the news. He had to get his few surviving men to safety.\n\nLooking in the mirror, he could see smoke rising from what remained of his border post as well as a dozen sets of headlights. The OFN Antarctic Administration had launched a surprise strike in the dead of night, smashing their way through the paltry, lightly-armed defenders on the border. Freitag and his men quite simply didn't have the firepower necessary to deal with the Canadian armored snow crawlers, they had plowed through the paltry fortifications crushing all in their path.\n\nThe weapon shipments and overall combat capability of Neuscwabenland had deteriorated severely, and Freitag knew that the OFN would be upon Schirmacher within the week. That left only seven days to destroy all compromising materials and make an exit stage left from this shithole of a continent.\n\nHe just prayed his engine would hold out, and that Mayr had some sort of plan for this eventuality."

 antarctica_aag_alert_event.20.desc:0 "To: Deutsche Gesellschaft für Polarforschung\n\nFrom: Ernst Hermann\n\nSubject: Argentinian and Chilean territorial trespasses.\n\nBegin: In recent weeks, we have seen increasing numbers of Argentinian and Chilean ships and aircraft crossing into our waters and airspace. The vehicles in question refused to alter their courses when ordered to, and due to standing Abwehr orders, were not fired upon by our personnel. These transgressions seem to be done for convenience's sake, not for military purposes; the vehicles in question were lightly armed and took the most direct routes to their destinations.\n\nThis flagrant violation of our territorial integrity and legitimacy leaves us exposed to advances from the Japanese and Americans, who have no doubt observed our failure to act. I formally request that the Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda assert Germania's authority over Neuschwabenland. If immediate action is not taken and our legitimacy is challenged again, we will be powerless to keep our colony and research facilities from being partitioned by our neighbors.\n\nSieg Heil."

We immediately extended our diplomatic feelers towards the Argentinians and Chileans about the flagrant yet nonviolent incursions into our territory. They denied it totally and denounced what they stated was a blatant attempt by the Reich to slander its Antarctic competitors. This overt rebuke surprised us, as both Chile and Argentina have at least nominally good relations with the Reich itself.\n\nWe have horrible news: through Advair contacts, we have discovered that the actions of the Chileans and Argentinians are part of a wider scheme to dismantle Neuschwabenland. The OAA, and by some reports, even the Japanese, have coordinated a plan to partition our territory and seize our sensitive documents and materials. The fact that even the Chileans and Argentinians are willing to join this venture speaks to how far our legitimacy in Antarctica has fallen. We recommend an immediate evacuation of the colony and destruction of anything they could use against us. Needless to say, the Reich will not embark on a World War over a barren patch of ice, especially with the deteriorating situation at home.\n\nSieg Heil."

 antarctica_aag_alert_event.30.desc:0 "Quartermaster Elias Baumann saluted as he entered Mayr's office. "At ease," Mayr said. "Please, sit down.\n\nBaumann squeezed into the chair opposite Mayr. His huge frame barely fit the old oak arms of the chair. Mayr lit a cigarette and contemplated its glowing tip as he spoke to the Quartermaster. "I've received reports from multiple departments indicating our supplies of food, fuel, and ammunition are insufficient for our current upkeep." His eyes flicked up to Baumann.\n\nThe quartermaster sighed. "I tried to explain the situation to the department heads, that the Kriegsmarine resupply shipments are becoming sporadic. We should not act as if we have unlimited resources anymore. Schumann's requests are growing more grandiose by the day and I fear the well-being of the men will suffer for it."\n\nMayr puffed on his cigarette. "What is our current deficit and what would your recommendation be?"\n\n"We've far exceeded our usage of food for this season, and our fuel situation is dire. If we don't ration everything, we'll have starving men and grounded test aircraft before the next Kriegsmarine shipment. I'm recommending an immediate switch to three-quarter rations, cessation of unnecessary vehicle use, and lighter duties along the border until our supplies are refilled."\n\nMayr frowned. "Bad for morale and bad for our tests, upon which our existence is predicated. Germania does not accept failure. If we end up in this situation again, I think we'll be recalled, and I'll remind you that some of us were exiled for a reason. With the tumultuous situation back home, it might mean our deaths."\n\n"With that in mind Sir, I recommend that we immediately crack open the emergency supply cache.""

He'd attempted to consolidate the base's remaining supplies under armed guard and keep the lights on until the next shipment arrived, but it seemed all his efforts had been for naught. The staff had simply mismanaged the resources they were given, and as such, the feasibility of Schirmacher Station, and Neuschwabenland, was compromised.\n\nMayr had heard reports that the OFN had already seized the vacated outposts on the border, and that even the damn Ahnenerbe were taking potshots at Neuschwabenland soldats who got too close. Thus, Mayr made the incredibly hard decision to order an evacuation. All usable materials that could be used by the enemy were to be destroyed, and all men packed like sardines onto the few leaky Kriegsmarine vessels in Graf Spee harbor. They were going home, but not under the circumstances many would have liked. Mayr knew that he and the command staff would have to flee somewhere beyond the Reich's grasp; they certainly faced court martial back at home.\n\nThe generator growled and died, and with it went any hope of Neuschwabenland continuing its mission."

 antarctica_news_events.1.desc:0 "Word has reached the international community of a miraculous rescue in the farthest reaches of the Southern Hemisphere - and conducted from a most unexpected source. The Reich's territory in Antarctica, New Swabia, has long been suspected of chronic logistics shortages following the German Civil War, but the latest reports suggest that the isolated prison-state of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika has stepped in to aid the struggling outpost.\n\nWhile little news has yet escaped either New Swabia or Ostafrika, further Antarctic deployments of the American, Chilean, and Argentine air forces suggest that the continent will continue to be an area of contention for all major players. As the German Civil War trundles towards its conclusion, who knows how the new occupant of the Reichstag will choose to reassert control over the far south."

Rudolf Mayr has expressed his gratitude and, "is forever indebted to the Argentine people."\n\nThe OFN has already condemned Argentina, while the remnants of the Einheitspakt praise the nation.

Also known as New Swabia, said territory had already been going through supply struggles prior to the upheaval in Germany.

It doesn't matter where you're from, we all freeze the same."\n\nAdmiral Raborn has caught flack for the decision, but he has stood by his choice and is unlikely to lose his position thanks to his illustrious career."

Ritscher feuded with US Admiral Richard Byrd, as they led their respective country's initial forays into Antarctica. Since then, Ritscher has chaired the German Society for Polar Research.

Surprisingly, they found that the soldiers and scientists left at the outset of the war were still alive, at least partially, and had defended the claim against outside incursion into the territory. The reunion was a bright spark of joy standing in contrast to the ever darkening future, as the relief came as stocks and supply had dwindled to nearly nothing.\n\nNow, Germania must decide what to do with their fledgling territory. As of now, all signs indicate the new Führer is intent on the expansion of the far-flung bases with the purpose of "securing the future of the Reich," though how realistic this goal is has yet to be seen."

Fortunately for the besieged colony, they were able to push the SS out, losing dozens of lives and thousands of Reichsmarks in property damage.\n\nMany are concerned about the rationale for such an attack, saying that it was a politically motivated lie or that it was an inside job in order to purge opposition.

  # Brazil OSC Events
  BRA_antarctica.1.t: "Frozen Destiny"
  BRA_antarctica.1.d: "\"In short, we'll face no meaningful opposition.\"\n\nAdmiral Rademaker stood in a circle of officers in smart uniforms, huddled around a large map of the frozen continent: Antarctica. Their faces were as bright as the overhead lights. Rademaker worked his jaw. \"Can we trust the Americans on this?\"\n\n\"They've conducted extensive surveillance to reach this conclusion, sir.\" The junior officer motioned towards the map. \"The Americans are confident the Germans abandoned everything between these longitudes, all the way to the Argentine border.\"\n\n\"It will be a swift operation, then.\"\n\nRademaker retreated from the circle, stepping towards the windows of the command room of Minas Gerais. The proud flagship of the Brazilian Navy was at his feet, in all its armored glory. Modern aircraft lined its deck, falcons atop the frothing waves. A crew hundreds strong kept the iron behemoth alive, cutting through the expanse of the South Atlantic at its Admiral's behest.\n\nIt must be destiny, Rademaker thought, that Germany had fallen into turmoil at the time it did. It would be him, at the head of the great fleet that spread over the horizon, that'd win this next great victory for Brazil. They'd sweep south and provide Brazil with the prestige of an Antarctic territory; punish the Germans after their insults in the Lobster War, and push the Argentines against the ropes.\n\nAnd for no cost, too. Another medal for Brazil—another medal for himself. He turned to the officers with a faint smile. \"Let us not delay in our duty, gentlemen.\""
  BRA_antarctica.1.a: "No meaningful opposition."
  BRA_antarctica.2.t: "The Southern Theater"
  BRA_antarctica.2.d: "Admiral Rademaker arrived at Ritscher Base trailing the first echelon of Brazilian marines. They rushed, guns drawn, towards buildings scorching black amidst the white wasteland.\n\nThe only building left standing was a hospital - four walls and a rotten roof. Their rifles poked the bodies on the rows of beds and found limbs frozen stiff—skin in unnatural blue and purple stuck loosely to their bones, thin like the tattered mattresses. To think their comrades had simply left them for dead. Rademaker shuddered at the thought\n\n\"We got lucky,\" said one of the marines, smiling. \"Every German here is dead.\"\n\nBut casualties came, anyway: two marines were blown back by a minefield around the abandoned radio station; another, just a kid, had his face disfigured by a tripwire bomb. American intelligence was half correct. Though the Germans had abandoned their only major outpost, they had not left it undefended, leaving gifts behind that'd snatch as many Brazilian lives as they could.\n\nRademaker inspected the charred alleyways, trampling over snow that turned gray with ash. He hadn't anticipated the Germans would opt for a full-scale immolation of the base. This was more than a temporary retreat to resort to such permanent measures, things must have been far worse for them than reported. The admiral watched his men throw frozen German corpses into piles outside the hospital, replenishing the beds with their own injured. They'd have nothing against the cold but the sheets of the dead before them.\n\nThe wind whispered in Rademaker's ear as his men huddled together. How would he keep them alive for weeks without appropriate shelter? How long until new supplies arrive? The admiral's mind was blank. Empty and frozen like the miles and miles of ice around them. Though the Germans were gone an enemy remained for them to face, one far deadlier than any soldier..."

  BRA_antarctica.3.t: "Preemptive Gambits"
  BRA_antarctica.3.d: "Admiral Rademaker paced about his stateroom feeling subtle vibrations of the waves below hitting his carrier. This whole operation was starting to look like a mistake. The Brazilians had been lucky not to meet many enemy forces in their occupation of the territory. But nature and logistics made powerful enemies in the Antarctic.\n\nShelter was in short supply, as were shipments of resources. The Americans had offered to help, but Rademaker knew better than to fall for that trap a second time. If he accepted, the Brazilian forces would be made all the more dependent on the United States here in Antarctica. They would want guarantees, assurances that the Brazilians would open a second flank against New Swabia whenever the Germans came knocking again. Given the pitiful state of the Brazilian forces, the Admiral doubted they could hold for long. With such a shortage of supplies and morale, they were barely surviving the weather alone, and winter was fast approaching. No, he needed a backup plan. Retreat home was not an option, but perhaps there was an alternative.\n\nHe sat back down at his desk and looked over a map of Antarctica to their east the large mass of German New Swabia loomed over their paltry territory, but to the west there was something far more manageable. The Argentinian claim, sitting ripe and undefended, its commander far too concerned with their feud with Chile and quixotic adventures to be able to resist for long. Rademaker smirked. Leal believed that leading an expedition to The South Pole would make the world respect Argentina's borders. It was almost comically naive to Rademaker. Fame and glory could do little to protect their claim if push came to shove.\n\nPlans were already forming in his head. Not a mere exit strategy, but a conquering exodus that would preserve the prestige of his country and career should worst come to pass. For now, Rademaker would hold his ground..."
