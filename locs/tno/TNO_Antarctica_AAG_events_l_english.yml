 antarctica_aag_flavor.1.t:0 "To His Memory"
 antarctica_aag_flavor.1.desc:0 "Rudolf Mayr stared down at the letter in his hands, still processing its contents. The trickle of news from the fatherland was always slow, and generally not overly welcome, but this hit Mayr harder than most. His friend, teacher, and sole ally in Germania, Alfred Ritscher had been many things to Mayr, and his death was a blow he was not ready for. He had passed quietly on March 30th, and Mayr was at least thankful his connections from the Third German Antarctic Expedition had fast-tracked the news down south.\n\nA few hours after receiving the news, Mayr sat with Schirmacher, as they reflected on their mentor's life. The two men had grown to appreciate the lessons they had learned from him during and after the Second World War, and when they were sent to Antarctica one of the more uplifting prospects was working with the captain again.\n\nNow, reclining in their chairs, smoking, drinking, and staring listlessly at the ceiling, the future looked far bleaker than back when they had "agreed" to come south.\n\n"So, who's our new contact in Germania now?"\n\n"Röbke has been put in charge of the Polar Society."\n\n"Ah, of course he would be..." Röbke had joined the Third German Antarctic Expedition - as the man to hold the rest of them to the party line. He was a devoted member of the NSDAP, and both airmen knew he would be more likely to listen to the party than to the needs of the territory.\n\n"...well then, the least we can do to honor Ritscher's memory is a toast. To a bright future!"\n\nThe two drank long from their glasses."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.2.t:0 "Mandatory Fun"
 antarctica_aag_flavor.2.desc:0 ""When's the last time you took a vacation, Richard?" From Mayr: an order disguised as a request phrased as a question. For Schirmacher, there was only one place to go. His old friend Abner, recently retired after a long career as a commercial pilot: he said the fishing was darn good off of the coast of South Africa (and safer than in West Africa, besides). It all happened so quickly: a clapped-out Ju 390 took him to the sprawling aviation complexes at Winhoek, then a slightly fresher Arado flew him and a planeload of wide-eyed German tourists down into the degenerate dens of Capetown.\n\nA short time later Schirmacher sighed contentedly, a beer in one hand and his fishing pole hooked, baited, cast, and stuck onto a pintle mount on the yacht's rail where he could keep an eye on it.\n\n"You've changed, Abner," he told his old friend without looking, a smile touching the corner of his eyes. "Retirement suits you."\n\nAbner grinned and patted his impressive stomach. "You haven't changed at all since Lufthansa," he said jovially. "Still hungry. It's good to have a chance to show you the finer things." Nodding, Schirmacher took another sip of his beer. German domestic - nearly as hard to find in South Africa as it was in Antarctica.\n\nThe sun was overly long in the sky, orange beginning to tint the water at the horizon as it began its descent. Its heat had long since ceased to bother Schirmacher. He was soaked in sweat, but the climate here in South Africa was a mere annoyance compared to the trials he'd endured in the past. Shorebirds circled off the coast far enough away for their shrieking to be atmospheric. The yacht's deckhands maintained a deferential distance, closing orbit to within drink-handling distance only when necessary - at times and places like this, South Africa almost seemed like the Reich's own placid little place in the sun.\n\n"No," Schirmacher thought, "I haven't changed at all.""

 antarctica_aag_flavor.3.t:0 "Back on the Lecture Circuit"
 antarctica_aag_flavor.3.desc:0 "The invitation was richly embossed with gold leaf. "Herr Herrmann, the German Society for Polar Research politely requests your presence in Bremerhaven to deliver a series of lectures on scientific and operational developments in Neuschwabenland." It was from the head of the DGfP, Flotillen-admiral Alfred Ritscher. Ernst hadn't seen Ristcher since serving as his deputy on the German Antarctic Expedition, going on a quarter-century ago. He smiled at the prospect of (temporarily) returning to academia, seeing the city again, catching up with an old colleague - better pack some brandy, that was always Alfred's drink.\n\nIn the jump seat of the long-range cargo plane Herrmann tired of re-checking his lecture notes and let his mind wander. Each leg of the trip took him a few more years into his own past. From Neuschwabenland to Buenos Aires: being ripped away from his students to help run Schirmacher Station just a few years before he'd planned to retire. Buenos Aires to Recife: the way he'd felt empty after the Second World War. The joy teaching had brought back into his life. Recife to Dublin: the golden years between the wars. Switzerland, Sweden, Greenland, Greece - a constant stream of adventures, all leading up to the expedition with Ritscher. Dublin to Bremerhaven: the horror of the Great War trenches, feeling shattered. Climbing that first mountain and knowing at the summit, shrapnel still scraping inside of him, that he'd be whole again.\n\nHerrmann snapped back to the present somewhere over the English Channel, alerted by the muffled roar of jet engines. Through the window he could see the lethal blade of a Ho 229 interceptor. He knocked on the cockpit door - what was happening? - but there was no response besides the panicked chatter of radio communications. Some minutes later the copilot emerged, face white as a ghost.\n\n"The Führer has been shot!" Hermann met his eyes with horror. "They've locked down German airspace. We need to turn around.""

 antarctica_aag_flavor.4.t:0 "Salvaging the SS Wotan"
 antarctica_aag_flavor.4.desc:0 "Franz remembered swallowing some disbelief when he'd been briefed. They took him off border patrol to look at what, decade-old ships? To salvage supplies that may not even still exist? He thought he'd managed to keep any traces of skepticism from his face. It took four days to make the journey out to the old anchorage. The one blessing was being paired with the squad he'd led for going on 15 months now, and for once having a proper supply train.\n\nThe ships stood out there like ghosts - Franz couldn't quite pick out whether that was because of grey paint or the effects of weather and time. Time was something they didn't have. Just a few days to walk out while the ice held and see if there were any supplies to be found in these old relics. They'd only be able to investigate a few of them before the season turned and walking the ice became suicidal.\n\nOnly one of those wrecks was a sure bet, the records were clear. The Wotan, a ship forged by the 3rd Reich back in 1944 and still an impressive vessel today. Run aground due to its crew's incompetence in 1954. Franz thought it still looked fresh - the least frozen of the vessels, certainly - but beneath the surface, he knew that her back was broken.\n\nThe patrol group wasted no time and cut straight through the side of the hull like vandals. The ship's frame was twisted, crooked, every door and hatch jammed into itself. But room by room Franz's squad advanced relentlessly, seeking what they knew to be there, until finally they pried the last door open and looked upon the first true prize from their little expedition. Nonperishable food. Medical supplies. Clothing. And - what could be more priceless down here? - liquor."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.5.desc:0 "Franz didn't even need to squint as he looked at the sun and all the warmth it failed to provide just a few pleading degrees above the mountains inland. He'd seen enough winters here (Christ, enough for several lifetimes) to know that summer was coming soon. That the ice forming the path out to those wrecked ships would no longer be safe. And this expedition, weighed down with loot from the Wotan, couldn't carry much more with it back to Neuschwabenland.\n\nOne more ship, one more salvage effort. That was the limit. He resisted the urge to brush at the frost forming on his eyelashes with his gloves - that'd only make things worse - you had to just grit and bear it. One more ship.\n\nThere was the Antonio - an old pre-Triumvirate Italian vessel, closest to the shore, looked to be the easiest to climb aboard. The Ponce de León - an old so-called 'Liberty' ship that seemed to still be in good condition. And the Saint Brendan - the newest of the three. Franz's superiors appeared to be interested in it, although he'd been briefed that there was likely nothing of use left onboard."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.6.desc:0 "It was an Italian freighter hired under contract, the payment in wheelbarrows of Reichsmarks more than enough for its crew to walk away rich men after running it aground at the bottom of the world. The ship was from happier times, from before the Reich had torn its pound of flesh out of the Mediterranean Sea, but not so long before that the trial that would break the Pact of Steel hadn't already started.\n\nFortunately enough, time had created a walkable (with the aid of pitons and axes) yet frozen bridge from the surface of the ice up to the main deck. Franz's patrol group was able to make its way to the forward deck hatch without issue, and the scant remaining grease on the hinges enabled them to open it with only the bare groan of steel on steel.\n\nA flashlight's warm beam only revealed what they'd suspected to be the truth already: no remaining supplies. But Franz gave his patrol permission to descend into the hold regardless - they were here already - and before long they saw the corpses.\n\nHow could this be possible? An abandoned Italian supply freighter, on a supply run to one of the Reich's colonies, and unrecorded bodies in the hull? This wasn't right, Franz thought to himself, these men travelled to the ends of the earth in our service. They deserve a proper burial. Quickly, he issued orders for them to be hoisted from the hold, covered in blankets, and respectfully lowered onto the waiting sledges."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.7.desc:0 "The Ponce: an American liberty ship gifted to the United Kingdom and then pressed into service by their conquerors, still in use at least a half-decade after its designers had expected it to shake to pieces. This was a war emergency vessel, built in a hurry, but those American rivets were now reinforced by ice and might never come apart.\n\nNeither would the doors covering the forward hold, apparently, or the crew entry hatch. The patrol set at the rear hold hatch with prybars for 20 minutes before it, too, proved to be frozen solid. After quickly consulting with his staff sergeant, Franz ordered his men to build a fire on deck. Within two hours, they were able to melt the ice holding the hinges over the forward hatch and pry the doors open.\n\nThe hold was empty. Franz ordered his men to look more closely - maintenance rooms, supply caches, emergency repair tooling, surely there must be something here? There was: welding supplies and hardwood in each supply closet, redundant fuseboxes at every junction, a steadily-growing sense of appreciation for the sensible, robust construction of what was supposed to be a scrappily-built wartime emergency ship,\n\nFor most of Franz's squad, this was their first encounter with American material. The encounter was sobering... humbling, even. For racial degenerates, Americans sure knew how to design a ship."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.8.t:0 "Salvaging the Saint Brendan"
 antarctica_aag_flavor.8.desc:0 "The Saint Brendan was the newest hulk to freeze into the local landscape, a post-war Irish civilian vessel pressed into service in the '50s like so many others - and, like so many vessels pressed into service, she'd run aground. She likely had years of life left in her, but some administrator had clearly deemed a recovery effort uneconomic years ago.\n\nThe old Saint'd found a new world - just not the one he would have wanted. According to the records shared with Franze, she'd been on a simple supply run when run aground and the last of the cargo she'd carried had been carted away to Neuschwabenland years ago - but Franz had orders to examine her regardless.\n\nJust as records promised, all external doors were locked and the locks treated with cold-weather grease. After that, it took only a matter of minutes to fully verify that the ship had been stripped clean. The only things remaining from its former mission were the Swastikas half-heartedly painted on the forecastle.\n\nNothing could be salvaged here - but still, after a complete search, Franz felt that something was missing. He picked through his memory - wasn't there an old Wehrmacht dictakt, from before the war, that stated sensitive communication equipment should be destroyed where possible? It was unlikely that any non-German would ever come across this ship, but still...\n\nThe very moment he started picking through the ship's logs in preparation for demolition, something seemed strange. The tone - too familiar, too secretive. Before it arrived in Neuschwabenland, this vessel had been in direct communication with the Irish Taoiseach. The contents of those messages - encrypted, but nothing the Abwehr couldn't handle - would likely be of interest to their benefactors back home."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.9.desc:0 "Calling the sub cramped would be an understatement- it was more like a steel coffin. Stefan gazed into the icy abyss, occasionally checking his radar for their destination, Peter I Island, home to the most isolated outpost of Neuschwabenland which was always in need of a resupply. Karl sat next to him. 'Sat.' Stefan chuckled to himself. There was barely enough room to breathe in this damned midget submarine, and certainly not enough to sit down in any sort of comfort. No, both men were instead lying down in the tiny sub, close enough to see the other's breath turn to mist. It was quiet for a while - neither man wanted to shatter the silence, until eventually Karl drew a breath. "Stefan, you're one of Speer's liberals, aren't you?" Stefan turned and snarled. "I serve Hitler loyally, same as you. His successor, whomever that may be will also receive my devotion, while I believe Speer is the best choice, I am not a liberal. I am as committed to National Socialism as you are." Karl stifled a laugh. "I didn't take you for a comedian, Stefan. Everyone on this base knows you're a fucking Jew-lover. Everyone on this base knows why you're here." Karl's tone was light, and his mouth was bent in a slight smile, but as Stefan looked into his icy blue eyes, he saw no sign of mirth or humor; Karl was dead serious.\n\n"Of course you'd believe that. You practically worship Heydrich. You believe that everyone who's not blonde like you should be shot, that the Reich should jump at its own shadow and not stand secure in our eternal victory."\n\n"I'm not going to apologize for being superior," Karl retorted. "Heydrich will bring positive change to the Reich and cleanse the rot that has corrupted every facet of our Volk. We've grown degenerate; the Jews you seem to love so much have once again infiltrated us."\n\n"Albert Speer has a true vision for the future of the Reich, he realized the Führer's dreams and when he is in charge he will fix our Reich. Now, can you shut up so we can deliver these supplies?" "Whatever you say, Jew-lover." Karl spat."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.10.t:0 "Antarctic Sojourn"
 antarctica_aag_flavor.10.desc:0 "Andreas woke up to a blaring alarm. As usual, he groaned, got out of his bunk, and dropped to the cold metal floor: he had done it a thousand times, after all. It was always something. Some sort of drill, like last week. A false torpedo warning, maybe? It didn't matter to him. Every day was the same: wake up, check his schedule, do work, eat, do work, go back to sleep. That was life on a submarine, after all: there simply wasn't much to do. He checked what he had to do today: he was happy to see that it was look-out duty.\n\nIt was his favorite task; up on the deck, using the periscope, it was just him. No Friedrich, who chews with his mouth open. No Hans, who wouldn't stop talking about how he missed his girlfriend. No Karl, whose incessant humming drove Andreas mad. No, up here, it was just him and the ocean. Although, there was another reason he enjoyed his time keeping watch: sleep. They hadn't detected any OFN or Japanese ships and Andreas was confident they had maintained a modicum of stealth during their Antarctic sojourn. It gave Andreas much-appreciated time to rest his eyes, away from Friedrich's snoring. It was sleep that he needed. That isn't to say Andreas didn't keep a look out- of course he did. There just wasn't a lot to look for. Endless blue, broken now and then by a whale or dolphin. If Andreas had been an artist, he would have painted it.\n\nBut he wasn't. So he gave it one more glance before shutting his eyes. Of course, he immediately opened them again; the giant white shard of icy land he was looking at hadn't been there before.\n\nThe Aryan explores, as is both his right and responsibility. Andreas felt the same blood that ran through Leif Erikson flow through him. The same drive, pushing him forward. The same urge to explore, to conquer, to realize his destiny. That same excitement that Leif Erikson must have felt when first laying eyes on Vinland - Andreas felt it too, as he gazed onto the vast white wasteland that was Antarctica."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.11.desc:0 "As Stefan glided across the finish line, Karl, relegated to second place, immediately jumped off of his sled and rushed up to Stefan. Karl was furious, of course he was. He immediately turned to Stefan with a curse in his mouth, fury in his eyes, and a balled-up fist. As Stefan and Karl locked eyes, the other men untethered their dogs from the sleds and paid the other two no mind; they were too busy bickering about the race. After all, the wager between them was a week of the other's coffee - a reward worth more than gold, here in Antarctica.\n\nNo, as the men stood and playfully argued, Stefan and Karl remained locked in a battle - each looked into the others eyes searching for any hint of weakness or mercy. Neither saw any sign in his opponents eyes. Hans snarled and spat.\n\n"You fucking cheating bastard son of a Jew."\n\nDespite the cold, despite the frostbite eating away at his extremities, Stefan's blood was set on fire. Anger, confusion, and fear coursed through his veins: Was Hans lucky? Was he throwing insults out to see if one stuck? Did he know something about Stefan that he had tried his entire life to keep secret?\n\nHe didn't have time to answer any of these questions; the next thing he knew, his hand was curled up into a fist and covered in a warm, red liquid. Karl stood back, his hands pressed to the shattered remains of what had once been a perfect Aryan nose. The "crunch" had led to the other soldiers turning around to see the results of the brief skirmish. They both ran to separate the two soldiers, but there was no need; Stefan had already proven his martial superiority over his opponent."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.12.desc:0 "It began with the rumbling. A deep, groaning roar from far below the floor of the base that seemed to come from the bowels of Hell itself. Dust fell from the ceiling in gentle waves and delicate instruments were dashed to pieces. Then, during a flyover of the coast Oberleutnant Hoffman finally noticed from the sky what it was impossible to see from the ground - the entire base was on the verge of drifting away - the iceberg on which it stood had almost calved away entirely from the continental mass. Before his wheels even touched the ice he had radioed back.\n\nBefore even the humans could leave, the equipment had to be salvaged. Substation B-15 held delicate magnetic equipment that had been manufactured at immense cost back home in the Reich - equipment that would take months to manufacture again. First they tried flying them out, before it was concluded that it was too risky and jarring. Then they tried driving them out, before realizing that the jolts and jumps of the trucks were just as bad. And so finally, it was decided to use the most primitive method of all - sled dogs for motion, with one man physically carrying the instruments and acting as human suspension. All the while, the deep cracks that had fissured across the few meters of ice that still connected the base to Antarctica grew deeper and deeper.\n\nNext out were the supplies and essentials. Through freezing blizzards and visibility near blindness braved the trucks, engines roaring against the cold, while the ice cracked and splintered and the rumblings grew louder and louder.\n\nFinally, the men left. Some went on the planes, most on the trucks, and a few with the dogs - they needed to get out too. On a relatively bright day B-15 stood utterly abandoned, the deep snow around it covered in tire marks, footprints, and frenzied pawprints. It was on this day that, with a shattering jolt, the iceberg on which it stood calved entirely and began free-floating into the endless sea. No casualties or significant losses - thankfully."

After all this cold I'm looking forward to getting some sun in Afrika, and besides, between you and me, they say that Russia is getting very... unstable. I'd avoid it."\n\nBoth men bid farewell to each other as they boarded the planes that would scatter them to the four corners of the Earth - or the Reich, at least - to spend their holiday, a scene that repeated itself all across Schirmacher Station as the summer crew departed and the winter crew arrived.\n\nThe station itself seemed lonelier than usual as it continued operating on half staff - an atmosphere conducive to depression, something the higher-ups had realized, and so a morale boosting activity had been planned this winter that the entire station was abuzz with excitement for. As the ships and planes carrying the summer personnel departed and those carrying supplies slowly increased in number, the arrival of one ship in particular was eagerly anticipated. And then finally, on the same day as the last troopship left, it arrived.\n\nA gigantic movie-projection screen, accompanied by an industry-size projector, fully equipped with the latest movies from Germania and one in particular that would make full use of the enormous, theatrical speaker set that came with. "Triumph of the Will", by Leni Riefenstahl.\n\nAnd so was born a new Antarctic tradition - one night of laughing, joking, and movie-watching that the higher-ups felt would benefit "national spirit" and that the men simply enjoyed for what it was, the chance to watch a movie. Most were certainly inebriated, joined by their comrades that they would be shacked up with over the longest, harshest winter in the entire world. Some would leave as the cold worsened and supplies dwindled, but for now they could at least relax and enjoy themselves."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.14.desc:0 "Schirmacher Station abounded with excitement as the first personnel ship arrived from Germany, filled with crew, supplies, and the newest technology Germania was willing to give the far-flung base. The next few weeks saw the entire winter staff leaving and the summer staff slowly moving in, causing a flurry of activity. In the midst of this chaos, the few permanent staff were left at the base with little to do as roles shifted and most departments were left temporarily understaffed.\n\nOne of these permanent staff members, Herst, an engineer tasked with clearing up an old storage room in one of the original buildings of the base, was hard at work. The young engineer was initially surprised at the lack of interesting antiques contained in the half-decrepit building, most things being either rusted tools or slowly decaying uniforms, until he happened upon a single unsuspecting wooden crate. Opening it, he uncovered a stack of old large film reels, seemingly stowed away years before. The dates printed on the tapes' containers ranged from the 1930s to 1955, before ending with a single shorter unlabeled reel.\n\nA couple hours later, Herst was gathered near the recently created theater, huddling with a few other permanent staff at the base around a much smaller screen meant to ensure film was still usable for movie nights the higher-ups occasionally put on. As they flicked through the tapes, which turned out to be newsreels and movies from around the world, they fell into a comfortable rhythm, despite the undoubtedly illicit nature of these tapes sourced from around the world.\n\nSo, the small group of Antarctic residents found themselves spending their abnormally long break whiling away the hours with old films as they waited for summer's approach."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.15.desc:0 "Herst and his companions had suffered through a rough week. First, the most recent supplies had contained less food and goods to go around, leading to an overly dour mess hall. Next, news of tensions heating in Germania between the military and student-led protesters led to a minor brawl consisting of a couple of the locally stationed troops, some of reform minded engineers and scientists, and one very stiff officer. Finally, as the cruel punchline at the end of the relentlessly unforgiving joke being made at the base's expense, heating had gone out in one of the dormitories, causing the other dorms to be cramped and the engineering team a long, freezing, and needlessly complicated graveyard shift. All of this happening during the departure of the summer crew and the arrival of the winter crew only exacerbated these problems.\n\nThe now tightly knit group of permanent base residents found themselves taking their only solace in the weekend's promise of a short break from work and time to enjoy each other's company.\n\nThis led Herst to gather together with his peers around an increasingly familiar projector screen to watch the final tape from the mysterious wooden crate he had found. Everyone fell silent as the abnormally short tape began its quiet whirring in the projector. Up until now they had been a mixture of Hollywood movies, British newsreels, and the German films the men knew well from their childhood. However, this reel was different. It was the compiler of these films touring Schirmacher Station as his farewell to its inhabitants and the land around it.\n\nThe group stayed up long into the night, laughing, reminiscing, and savoring the last of the tapes that had brought them into regular contact."

Recent modifications to the tractor allowed much greater fuel efficiency with which such a rescue could be attempted. Stopping at the resting place of the lost patrol, Dr. Frederick and Lieutenant Wagner exited their tractor to investigate the remains of an identical tractor and the poor souls frozen inside.\n\n"Any idea what happened?" Wagner asked.\n\n"Not sure yet" Frederick replied, "No bullet holes, no signs of battle." Frederick pointed at the passenger side door of the lost tractor. "Get this thing open" Frederick sat in the warmth of the idling tractor as Wagner and his men struggled to pry open the frozen doors of the Antarktispatrouillengruppe's tractor in the freezing cold. After spending 20 minutes failing to make any progress with the crowbar, Wagner finally resolved to simply shoot open the window and climb through it.\n\n"We got your fuckin' door open Frederick, if you care to freeze with us!" Taking the hint, Frederick exited the warmth of his tractor in order to climb inside a nearly identical freezing tractor. The sun had gone down bringing the temperature down another 10 degrees.\n\n"I don't understand doc, why did they freeze, they should have had enough benzene to keep the tractor running through the storm." Frederick grabbed a jerry can labeled "Benzene" and tipped it upside down. Liquid gasoline came gushing out. "Maybe we should check the engine," Frederick suggested. The hood was spared most of the frost allowing the engine to be accessed easily.\n\n"Shit," Wagner said, "The oil froze. Did they turn off the engine?" Frederick paused, racking his brain "No, they didn't. The fuel saving modifications include a valve to reduce the benzene consumed while idling, causing a lower engine temperature, with the cold of night and the tractor stopped because of the storm, the oil was able to freeze, while the engine was running.""

Ten kilometers back, his weapon cleaning kit, the lubricant turned into rubber cement by the same cold. 5 kilometers, his binoculars - once a precious gift from his late father, now a lead weight rendered useless by the glare. Their platoon halted and Paul eagerly tossed his pack onto the ground - lightened or no, exhaustion had long since seeped into his bones and made itself a comfortable home there. His rest wouldn't last. The field manual he'd memorized long ago in combat school - every word written in the blood of heroes on the Eastern Front - was clear. At the halt the first task of any soldier was to dig in, one foxhole every five meters. Sighing (internally, to conserve the loss of moisture from exhaling) Paul retrieved the entrenching tool from his pack and began to dig.\n\nClang. Clang. The sound of meters-thick ice on rock. Paul's progress was achingly slow and he wasn't sure if his calorie-deprived strength would last from one shovelful to the next. He jealously eyed the fresh snow just a few feet to the left and right of his position, cursed, and told his pacing Unteroffizier about the situation.\n\n"You know the regulations. Put the holes five meters apart," the grizzled sergeant spat back, looking for all the world like a veteran of the Franco-Prussian War. Paul's voice grew higher in desperation, knowing he couldn't possibly dig a foxhole here, knowing the price of insubordination, knowing that the evening would bring his second day without eating anything more substantial than dry crackers.\n\n"I'm telling you, I can't dig here!

Paul thought to himself, kicking at the step of his shovel in a vain attempt to chisel more than a small surface scraping of ice away from a pile of snow. "They're probably just hazing me because I'm the new guy. The Reich must have machines that can do this in minutes." But it took Paul's 19-year-old back a full 8 hours. It took his last ergs of energy to fall into a seat at the nightly enlisted poker game. "Tough day?" Martin asked, "Piece of cake," Paul responded. Martin exchanged a knowing glance with his fellow soldaten.\n\nPaul rolled out of bed on the second day moaning. The whole of his back felt like one big bruise. The calluses on his hands hadn't fully formed and every small movement created another pink, angry crack on his dry knuckles. He stared at his shovel in hatred, knowing what every second of the next 8 hours would feel like. "Second day's always the hardest," Martin said sagely when Paul dragged himself to the poker table. Paul resisted the urge to comment on Martin's genealogical heritage.\n\nSurely there was a better way. Paul woke up early on the third day no less physically broken, but filled with ideas. The problem was that none of them worked: fire only created a new layer of unbreakable ice. The pickaxe he'd borrowed from a scientist just poked useless holes. And boiling water made the problem even worse. No, the shovel was the only way. Paul skipped poker that night in a hard mood, thrashing around in his rack with the knowledge of what the rest of his tour of duty would be like. The fourth day passed excruciatingly slowly, Paul counting every yard preciously as he earned his way towards freedom for the night. But when he walked into the poker game, something had changed: Martin smiled when he saw him and gestured towards a seat. No, not a seat, his seat. "We're playing Prussian Hold 'Em. 5-card river, 3 mark blind," he said, dealing Paul's hand. "And to make things interesting - winner's off snow clearance duty for a week." Paul eyed the degenerate monarchs in his hand greedily."

His flight from Windhoek to Hamburg had turned into the voyage from Hell following the failed attempt on the Führer's life. His plane had been denied access to German airspace and instead had to touch down in the dilapidated facility that passed for London Airport. The plane then bounced to Oslo, Copenhagen, and even Prague before finally reaching its destination in Munich.\n\nThe bags under Herrmann's eyes told the story of the trip, and Ritscher, seated across from Herrmann, could do only one thing: offer the man a drink. Not from his own stores, naturally, but from the gift of brandy Herrmann brought with him. "The lecture series," said Ritscher, "has obviously been cancelled." He leaned in and lowered his voice. "Nobody wants to hear about penguins while the Führer's on life support."\n\n"After the trip I've had," said Herrmann, "that's fine with me.

 antarctica_aag_flavor.21.desc:0 "The tiny radio blared to life, propaganda from the Reich spewing from it. With the old, uncomfortable headphones, it was hard for Stefan to ignore the calls for cleansing against Jewish rats and other degenerates - it seemed that a member of the SS was currently speaking, judging by his constant praising of Heydrich - something Karl would appreciate, no doubt.\n\nIt's not like Stefan would tell Karl (or any of the others, for that matter) about the radio. There was a reason he was listening to it underneath the sheets, at an ungodly hour, with headphones set to the lowest they could possibly be. No, it wasn't state-sponsored propaganda that Stefan wanted - he wanted news, the real news; he wanted music that made him feel something.\n\nIn the pitch dark, it was impossible to make out the various knobs and buttons, but Stefan had become quite adept at this particular part of the process. In no time, he was connected to the McMurdo Radio. He spoke very little English, but it was worth it just for the music, music that Karl would deride as "degenerate." Stefan didn't care. He loved it. For mere moments, he was able to forget that he was trapped in this icy hell, and lose himself in the music.\n\nThe news segments were different for Stefan; although he could catch a few words now and then, for the most part, he had no idea what was being said. However, the speaker had a soothing, exotic voice, Australian? American, maybe? It reminded him that there was a world outside of the cold metal prison he resided in, one which didn't cower under the swastika.\n\nHe always had to be careful not to fall asleep listening to the radio. He had no idea what the others would do if they found him with it, but he knew it wouldn't be pretty, for either him or the radio."

 antarctica_aag_flavor.22.desc:0 "Everything happened in a whirlwind - or a blizzard, more accurately. First, news from the Reich - the Führer was dead. Despite Hitler choosing a successor, there still seemed to be some sort of... struggle for power. News from the Reich came in a rapid flurry, like tiny snowflakes before a massive drift - supplies were halved, then quartered, then cut entirely; funding was cut, men were no longer being sent to relieve those on duty.\n\nIt was better when there was news, no matter how bad it was, Stefan thought. It was when reports stopped coming that Stefan felt the sense of doom ramp up. At least with reports on how bad the outside world's situation was, Stefan could pretend - if only for a moment - that he was connected to it. No, when the icy silence set in, Stefan would swear he was being driven mad. He had no idea who was winning in Germany; perhaps Speer, Stefan's preferred candidate, had taken power. Or maybe Heydrich, his worst nightmare, had established dominance. Hell, there was a small part of Stefan that entertained the idea that the OFN or CPS had intervened and the rest of the world was now bathed in the cleansing fires of the atom.\n\nHe looked up from the memo that was once again cutting the number of cigarettes afforded to the men, one eighth portions this time. There was no way this was going to be enough for anyone on the base, fights were going to break out, cigarettes were going to be stolen, people might get hurt. Stefan thought back to why he was even in this ice-covered hell. He thought it had been a great idea at the time; he'd always loved the cold, and he held a special place in his heart for penguins. Most importantly, he thought, the icy continent was a place away from the prying eyes of the SS that may inquire about his ancestry - maybe assuming that he's more of a Christopher Columbus than a Leif Erikson. As he looked up from the memo, his heart steeled - or froze, rather. He was no Leif Erikson. He was no Aryan explorer, who fought proudly for his people."

Yet with the crisis (both in the Reich and in Antarctica) Stefan was given the opportunity to put his once-frozen dreams into action. In the dead of night, while his bunkmates were sleeping, he crept like a ghost out of his room. He didn't take much; his coat, mittens, and all of his gear for the cold; his Luger and the bullets that came with it; his trusty radio; and the few rations he had left, as well as a couple (but not all) of Karl's. The base was silent. Because of the need to preserve power, there were no lights on; because of the need for sleep for everyone, there were no scientists or guards taking their normal places like busy bees. He made his way to the tiny submarine that he had once shared with Karl to retrieve supplies, and slowly set about preparing it for the voyage. In truth, he had no idea where he was going to go - maybe to the Chilean territory, where they were neutral (at least in theory). Maybe instead, he would attempt to go to the OFN's massive portion of the icy continent; after all, he'd be able to provide a great amount of intel for them. It didn't matter to Stefan right now. All he needed was to get off of this base.\n\n"You fucking Jew." A familiar voice cut through the icy silence, shattering it like glass. Karl stood in the doorway with his handgun out, pointing directly at Stefan's head. "I should have known something like this would happen. You're a dirty traitor, a dirty Jew. I should have killed you when we were in this submarine the first time."\n\n"Karl, you're insane if you think anyone here is going to survive. The Reich is in chaos we're all going to fucking die," Stefan called back, careful to keep his voice down.\n\n"If I die, it will be as an Aryan, dying for my people. I will not die like a rat, desperately trying to abandon ship. I will not die like a degenerate, like a dirty fucking Jew. Now, if you come along willingly, maybe the high command will be content not to kill you.""

And lose the incredible blackmail that I have against you? Not likely. When I tell them - and I will tell them - it will be because you are no longer of any use to me. Just like I'm sure your Jew-bitch of a mother wasn't of any use to your degenerate father after he used her." Karl turned, motioning for Stefan to follow him.\n\nBefore he knew what was happening, it was over; as Karl turned, Stefan had pulled out his own pistol; he pointed it directly at Karl's head and squeezed the trigger. In an instant, Karl's head was a mess of red and blonde, and Stefan realized what he had done. The gunshot echoed around the small metal room. Fortunately the submarine docks were too far away from the main habitats to wake anyone up. Stefan redoubled his efforts to prepare the submarine for his voyage, until finally, it was ready.\n\nAs Stefan got into the tiny submarine, hopefully for the last time, he was lost in thought. As he turned on the engine and the much-needed heating system, he realized that he had never truly been a Leif Erikson; he was never an Aryan. He had always been a Christopher Columbus - an imposter, a Jew, a liar. He had tried so hard to serve the Reich, to turn his back on his heritage, but he could not; no longer. As the submarine silently left the base, he brought his right pointer, middle, and ring fingers to his face and did something he had never done before, yet something he remembered his mother doing countless times; he prayed. He prayed for forgiveness, and for safe passage to:"

His gaze scanned the craggy rocks. So this was Kerguelen, the glorious bastion of French \"might\" in the Southern Ocean and essential supply hub for Neuschwabenland. It was run down, lightly defended, and the few sentries outdoors sat around smoking cigarettes while, what appeared to be, several fishermen carried a catch back to shore. The guards gave them not even the lightest inspection. A far cry from Neuschwabenland to be sure, but even for the French this was pathetic. Boxes of supplies were simply lined up on the docks: food, fuel, and other amenities essential to the Reich's polar outposts.\n\nBefore long, he was approached by Xavier Richert, the civilian administrator of this pitiful excuse for a base. The Frenchman hurried towards him before extending a clammy handshake. \"Herr Schirmacher! I apologize for the lack of a formal greeting, we were not expecting an inspection so soon...\"\n\n\"-And we were not expecting you to be so far behind schedule\" spat Schirmacher \"I was sent to investigate what possible catastrophe could have caused these delays, but it seems to be nothing more than mere indolence is to blame\".\n\nRichert blinked, a glint of frustration in his eyes, \"You ask the impossible, sir. We simply don't have enough transport vessels or seamen. I'm sure you are aware of the instability in the other colonies, to be frank, we are not exactly at the top of the metropole's priorities\".\n\nSchirmacher scoffed. \"It's not a problem we've faced in Neuschwabenland, I can assure you,\" he said, before pausing for a moment to consider an appropriate solution..."

Plus, he figured it couldn't be any worse than the Pervitin he's seen others take.

He took out his well used letter opener, and sliced the first of many open.\n\nIt was from Jacques Cousteau. Herrmann had heard of him, he was some sort of nature documentarian trying to film in Antarctica. He'd even caught a fuzzy radio broadcast or two here from his office. Cousteau was requesting permission to film in Neuschwabenland.\n\nIt was a risk to be sure. Mayr and Grasser wouldn't like the idea, he knew that much.

"I want to clear some things up," Koskell began, "First, despite what you may think, the Heer knows just about everything about you short of what hand you wipe your ass with. We know that your mother didn't move you to Hamburg in '58 like you told your unit, because she died in '57, we know that the reason you ended up in Hamburg is because you tried to smuggle yourself to Afrika on a cargo freighter, when you were discovered in Hamburg you were transferred to social services," Larson's jaw tightened, and he clenched his a fist, "Don't worry, you aren't in trouble, we've known since you came under our command," Koskell continued, "What we want... is for you to tell us about Madagascar." Larson's brow furrowed in confusion. Koskell continued, "The day you hopped onto that ship headed for Zentralafrika, there were also vessels departing for the other African colonies. One ship headed for Madagascar stands out as having been particularly easy to board for potential stowaways, yet you took a greater risk to go to Zentralafrika. Tells me you did your homework. So," Koskell leaned forward, "tell us about Madagascar"\n\nLarson gulped, taken aback by this turn of conversation, "Simply put, it's where the fuck ups get sent to die. Officers with undesirable politics, ineffective bureaucracy, and the so called 'honorary Aryans.' Additionally, there are endemic Black Death outbreaks because of the native Untermenschen's burial practices. It's the Reich's ass."\n\n"Thank you, you may leave now," Koskell said, waiting for Larson to leave, "And close the door behind you"\n\n"If the rumors are true," DeBoer began, "it might be useful to review some of the tropic warfare manuals.""

The Wehrmacht maintained several headquarters across the Reich, including the Bendlerblock in Berlin. These headquarters almost always came equipped with a lounge of some fashion stocked with only the finest refreshments available. Informal arrangements were frequently made and the politics of the Reich often played out in these backrooms.\n\nNeither Degen nor Zorn were strangers to such places and their activities, but as they entered the room, newly-won medals proudly displayed on their chests, the atmosphere struck them as markedly different. The officers, normally gregarious, kept strangely quiet apart from some warm congratulations and firm handshakes. It seemed everyone was afraid to speak, unsure of what word might be remembered and reported by present company.\n\nDegen and Zorn sat down by a tall window and poured themselves schnapps. Degen whispered, "Seems things have gotten worse since we left. I was holding onto a foolish hope that our victory might've marked a point at which we could rally the entire Wehrmacht. An uncontested victory."\n\n"Foolish indeed. It seems the divisions are deeper than ever, and I've no doubt that we'll see them deepen in the coming months," replied Zorn.\n\n"Let's be glad we're the ones wearing medals today, and let us not forget the men who sacrificed for them," said Degen raising his glass."To the victorious 2nd.""

Degen and Zorn had finished assessing the 2nd's Home Barracks and had come to a manor that commanded an impressive vista. They were shown to a balcony where their hosts waited.\n\nThe view of the alps was marred by the visage of an ancient Austrian and his protege: Generaloberst Valentin Feurstein, the seventy eight year old former Austro-Hungarian officer, leader of the 2nd Mountain Division, a veteran of both World Wars and the West Russian War, sat next to Generalleutnant Erwin Fusseneggar, quartermaster of the 2nd. While Degen and Zorn were responsible for the field operations of the 2nd, Feurstein and Fusseneggar were the ones to hold down the fort at home in Innsbruck, in addition to representing the interests of the Division politically. The Reich was a cutthroat place, and every corner begged for resources from the overstretched Reichstag.\n\nValentin motioned for Degen and Zorn to sit. "Opportunities for glorious victory are few and far between," he croaked, "I am glad the 2nd distinguished itself. Naturally, I have spread word of our accomplishment far and wide." He turned to Fussenegger, "This will ease your task of acquiring new material for us. The 2nd Division has a long and illustrious history and I'm thrilled to see it continue in these stagnant days.""

Besides a small contingent left behind in Antarctica, the entirety of the Divisions forces would be concentrated in Innsbruck. The heat was sweltering as the desert sun beat down. Zorn felt for the men below deck, confined to quarters as they transited the canal. The Italian Mare Nostrum did not take kindly to German interlopers, unless of course, they were willing to pay. Generalleutnant Degen had ensured Zorn that the proper Italian officials had been paid. Nevertheless, Zorn remained on-deck in case any trouble occurred.\n\nHis only company came in the form of cheap pine boxes, within which reposed the broken remains of many soldiers of the 2nd. Zorn sighed. He thought of his brother Generalmajor Hans who'd died on the Eastern Front in 1943, bravely leading his men in combat. Zorn wondered if he'd lived up to his brother's legacy. So many young men had died before he, and he felt as if he should never have left that squalid island.\n\nA ship's horn freed him from his melancholy. He took solace in the fact he'd returned with men at all. Living to fight another day was about the best one could hope for in the Reich."

They were to meet at the barracks on the outskirts of town with the rest of the command staff. Zorn knew that meant a meeting with the Austrian duo, Generaloberst Valentin Fuerstein and Generalleutnant Erwin Fussenegger. Zorn had a grudging admiration for the old Austro-Hungarian officer Feurstein, who was a veteran of both World Wars and led the Division to victory against the remnants of the Soviets in the 50s. Much of his strategy, in conjunction with his great age, was incompatible with modern military doctrine, and as such, Degen and Zorn had seen fit to confine his influence to Germany and his work to the political sphere, without him knowing it, of course.\n\nThis was made difficult by his protege Fussenegger, who had jockeyed for influence of his own and used his connection to Martin Bormann to keep the Division equipped with the newest and, most importantly, functional, equipment. Now that the four heads of the Division were in Germany, he was certain that a culmination of this struggle for influence was at hand.\n\nZorn entered the room where the three other heads were seated. Feurstein motioned for Zorn to sit, but wouldn't meet his gaze. "We've a lot to discuss, Generalmajor," the old man croaked. "Let's get started.""

Degen was now describing its successes and failures to the Austrians, Feurstein and Fussenegger, at Feurstein's villa in Innsbruck.\n\n"In general," Degen said, "our men performed as expected. Local Malagasy proved unable to withstand our assault or penetrate our defenses. However, the forces that both America and Japan brought to bear proved a different challenge. They demonstrated a remarkable capacity for combined arms that often left our formations at the mercy of armor and jet aircraft. I propose augmenting the Division's mountaineering capability with additional anti-aircraft and anti-armor units such that we remain competitive and adaptable no matter the battlefield or the enemy."\n\nFussenegger interjected with his attention fixed on Feurstein. "Using my connections to Bormann, we could attain powerful artillery at a modest cost, ensuring both the Division's firepower and endearing us to his cause.\n\nFeurstein stared through a window. The decision was ultimately his, and the other officers were wary of his old guard mentality. "Our men," he rasped, "showed remarkable bravery. Why not capitalize on what has worked in the past instead of reinventing the wheel, eh? Both of your proposals would reduce the effectiveness of the 2nd as a mountaineering formation. It is hard to carry artillery up a mountainside, as you know." He grew distant again. What Degen and Fussenegger might've construed as confusion on the part of the ancient general was in fact deep contemplation as he ruminated on the choices before him."

He remembered staring out the windows of the run-down apartment he and his three siblings called home, dreaming of the mountains which he was now scaling with Leutnant Koskell.\n\nKrüger would always count the days until the weekend when he could join his comrades in his Hitlerjugend uniform, leaving behind the overcrowded Munich, his parents' endless bickering, the jeering of the other kids in his class, and the beatings inflicted by his bullies.\n\nInstead of being the scared little kid who ate lunch alone, he was a member of something greater, something pure, and he was good at it.\n\nAs the mountain slope grew increasingly vertical Krüger remembered the endless days he had spent climbing rock walls in preparation for a Hitlerjugend mountaineering competition. By the time the contest commenced, Krüger had become comfortable carrying 75kg weights to the top of the rock wall, a true Aryan specimen. It would be this performance climbing the rock wall during the regional contest that would get him noticed by the Gebirgsjäger training academy in Innsbruck, and by Sofia Bauer, the girl who would turn the young Krüger into a man. The Hitlerjugend encouraged premarital relations between those of true Aryan stock after all.\n\nKrüger had been ecstatic upon being invited to join the ranks of the 2nd Mountain Division, a true elite formation, a brotherhood of National Socialism in a world crawling with vermin. Krüger snapped out of his daydream upon reaching the summit, helping hoist the lagging Leutnant Koskell up. "What're your orders?" Krüger asked the sweaty Koskell."

The pudgy quartermaster of the 2nd Mountain Division, Fussenegger was a political animal compared to Degen, rising through the ranks quickly to a position of influence as Feurstein's right hand. Degen knew Fussenegger had cultivated relationships with extremely influential people in the Reich and was wary whenever he was in earshot.\n\n"Hans, a moment of your time please," said Fussenegger, positioning himself in front of the door.\n\n"I'm too tired for whatever this is," said Degen.\n\n"You would go into battle without proper intelligence?"\n\nDegen sighed. "You have five minutes," he said as he opened the door to his room.\n\nThe men sat and Fussenegger commenced his spiel, "The day is coming when all of us will have to pick a side, even you, Hans. The political situation is far worse than you could possibly imagine. If we don't maneuver into the correct position, the 2nd might find itself at the whims of forces beyond its control."\n\nDegen grit his teeth, "Get to the point."\n\n"The point is that there is only one man we should throw the division's support behind: Martin Bormann. His influence runs deep across the south of the Reich, including Innsbruck. With our forces pledged to his cause, we need not fear the political machine.

For someone to possess such a flower, indicates that they are the real deal. A true mountaineer. For the Reich's Gebirgsjäger, the retrieval of one such flower was a necessity. For Wagner, it was a chore he had put off far too long.\n\nIt was nice to climb free of the weight of guns and munitions for once, he did not miss the bulky Antarctic jackets they had spent months training in. Peering through binoculars, Wagner spotted a patch of Edelweiss flowers on a ridge above. Setting down his pack, Wagner paused, before opting to just free climb up the mountain face rather than bother with a rope and pitons.\n\nRapidly scaling the rock wall, Wagner quickly reached the flower patch, and pulled a small budding Edelweiss from its roots. As Wagner turned the flower over in his hands, a drop of blood fell onto it. Looking up he saw the source.\n\nSoldat Bjørn Larsen, with blood dripping out of innumerable lesions.\n\nThe first time Wagner had seen Larsen's ghost, he had nearly passed out, by now he had grown more accustomed to it, and so he only flinched this time.\n\nA second drop of blood dripped onto the Edelweiss. This time the source was a soldier Wagner did not recognize. All across the mountain meadow, ghosts of the 2nd loomed, searching for the flowers they had never found.

We need victories, and fast."\n\n"Well thats why we are here Erhard, over the next few hours, advance recon elements will disembark from the Schwabenland," said Kottas. "In the coming days, a small flotilla will shuttle across additional elements of the 2nd Mountain Division to shore up the line and assist you in restoring order. That being said, overall command of the Division, it's operations and tasks will remain with Generalleutnant Degen."\n\nMilch smiled coyly.

The port was utter pandemonium, clogged with ships carrying German refugees from Madagascar and depositing a steady stream of men and material onto the many piers. From the deck of the Schwabenland II, Zorn could make out lightly-armed Afrikan auxiliaries, Wehrmacht personnel, and the grim Ostafrikan SS.\n\nBelow deck, the seasoned Antarctic contingent of the 2nd Mountain Division chafed under their winterized gear. The order had come from Degen himself: he'd wanted all elements of the 2nd to strike an elite and more importantly, ordered image in the face of the chaos. Unfortunately, this also meant that each man was swimming in an ocean of sweat. Zorn would make it a priority to acquire climate-appropriate uniforms.\n\nOn the docks, a brawl was in progress between routed troops from Madagascar and Ostafrikan SS bellowing insults about capitulating to the untermensch.\n\nThen the gangway of the Schwabenland II lowered and hundreds of the Reich's finest soldiers made their presence known. They didn't break their stride as they waded through the brawlers,the crowd parted like the sea and quickly fell aside for them. As Zorn made his way dockside, he spotted Generalleutnant Degen waiting alongside other officers of the 2nd Division. They saluted each other, echoing cries of Heil Hitler, and Degen shook Zorn's hand."

"Generalfeldmarschall Milch's Militärkommission von Madagaskar has informed us that several of the rebel groups have strongholds in the Central Highlands, one of which is even augmented by a functioning airbase. We could assault them in their homes in the terrain we are designed to fight in."\n\nZorn looked at the many defensive lines across the island. "These pockets of German resistance and isolated garrisons will crumble unless properly reinforced. The lines are porous, poorly chosen, and frankly poorly manned. Our men could rectify this, bolstering the Militärkommission's defensive capacity with our own, and buying time for the bulk of their forces to organize and get into position\n\nIt was a solid plan, if a little against the offensive doctrine Degen favored. The choice would be between cutting the head off the serpent by assaulting the mountains, or preparing for an attritional war by defending key areas. Whatever decision he made would characterize the entire conflict the 2nd faced."

He ducked into the trench as more shells pounded the surrounding area, churning the soil. The barrage was fearsome yet short. "Men!" Koskull shouted. "On the line! To your guns!" His timing was impeccable; a mass charge of infantry surged up the hill, bayonets and melee implements at the ready. They would never get the chance to use them.

Göring dipped another crisp into the tartare - it really was phenomenal - he could see Schörner out of the corner of his eye, sipping on what seemed to be water. Or maybe a vodka. Göring sipped his own.\n\nAccording to Schumann, the existing administrators - Mayr and Schirmacher - ran a tight ship. Göring himself had heard of the latter. Apparently they were doing some cold-weather testing for the Ho 229 and the next-generation air superiority fighter. Göring sipped his vodka again, and eyed the caviar on the platter in front of him - where did his caviar spoon go? It wouldn't due to be Slavic and use the soup spoon - ah.\n\nThe eventual invasion of America would benefit greatly by attacking their soft underbelly from below. And besides, Göring thought, licking his spoon - the very idea of 'manifest destiny' is a liberal fiction designed to deter the one true race from its own destiny. Besides, the Luftwaffe will need a top secret cold weather laboratory for the inevitable showdown in Russia.\n\nNo doubt Schörner had been the one to put this pamphlet on his desk - the man always had a motive, Göring thought as he watched his nemesis approach. But for once, we're in agreement."

They couldn't even provide a direct telephone connection. Yet another sign of the rot that afflicted the Führer's so-called allies. Hitler, in his drive for perfection and in his love of the One True Race, had but one flaw: his compassion. Heydrich remembered the exploits of Ritscher and the other heroes, the colonization of the ends of the earth. But as was the case far too often in the Reich, what was once good had decayed.\n\nThis 'Schirmacher Station' clung to the edge of life, relying on shipments from the motherland to survive. Aryan scientists had long known that the nutritious value of food could be sustained in low temperatures. What, then, could explain the rot that had clearly infected this once-proud outpost of the Reich? Why allow this mere colony, this... embarrassment, to blot the perfection of an untouched continent that stood to be conquered forevermore by the Aryan? What other race could ever hope to tame the savagery, to truly conquer this once remote climate where for once, a utopia free from degeneracy could be created?\n\nYes, Heydrich thought, feeling the warmth of enlightenment grow inside him - the driven snow. Untamed, to be sure, but pure, free from rot - and best of all, white. Himmler had already seen the wisdom of establishing a base on the continent. Heydrich now saw it too.\n\nThey wanted supplies, help. Their desperate messages - all double-checked by the increasingly-irrelevent Abwehr - warmed Heydrich's heart. He would help them! When the flow of supplies ceased - when the honeyed words of their contacts in the Reich were silenced with the garotte - when they were forced to confront the iron law of existence and their hearts were forged by its cruel reality - only then."

Albert Speer, chosen successor of the Führer, parted a sea of sycophants as he passed from one alcove to another. One exhibit featured massive prehistoric mammals the size of tanks, unearthed in the Eastern Reichskommissariats. Moskowien in particular contributed a Cave Bear the size of a Maus. The next displayed taxidermied great apes from the Reichskommissariat in the Congo. "These of course," said the tour guide, "are the direct forebears of the modern black savage. As you can see, not much has changed. Note the gait, the facial and nasal structure..."\n\nSpeer's attention wandered from the regularly-programmed party diatribe to a blinding white light coming from the end of the hall. As he strolled towards the source, his entourage quickly followed. He stood before a tableau of the Southern Continent: Antarctica. Stuffed penguins dotted the landscape and immense seals lounged on the rocks. He knew this display represented the German Antarctic colony of Neuschwabenland.\n\nLike every other facet of the moribund Reich, it was in dire need of reform. Speer knew, as with the rest of the Reich, he was the only one capable of ensuring sustainability. The current regime of Neuschwabenland from the reports he had glimpsed was inefficient and clumsy. The colonization efforts were a foolish waste of resources desperately needed in the east, however the aeronautics research facilities and nuclear test sites showed great potential for breakthroughs. The legitimacy of the Antarctic territory itself could be strengthened by greater Einheitspakt participation. By taking a page out of the OFN playbook Neuschwabenland's position would be secured, with relatively little cost for the Reich. In fact, this cooperation would spread the cost across several nations. Why else have friends if they cannot foot the bill occasionally?"

Eons-long gusts, propelled by forces far above the tallest mountains of that barren continent, roared into the crevasses and the myriad pock-marked rocks dotting the ice. Penguins shuffled across the ice, trembling in their blubbered coats. Seals were not spared from the fury of the wind - its formidable caress tumbled them to and fro as they rumbled ashore, and a couple were taken in their slumber as it robbed them of strength and breath.\n\nThe Führer had once said that those without the will to fight deserved not the right to live. Any observer of the Antarctic wind would have little choice but to agree."

In time, perhaps, it would move again to warmer climates, but that would only be when the ashes of the genus Homo faded from all memory. It had slumbered, undisturbed, beneath ice and snow for a hundred million years, keeping its secrets.\n\nLife of strange varieties had come to nestle in the bosom of this exile, and yet more life still visited from far off places, in vessels of wood and copper, nickel and steel. These visitors cheered, danced, lived and died on the threshold of this ancient land. Now, they were gone. The exile remained, but now given a name that inspired wonder - and fear - for all time: Antarctica.\n\nMore visitors came, this time soaring through the air like the long-dead reptiles that'd once called the sleeper home. In time, the exiled continent became a home for yet other exiles, and eventually a grave. Yet these newcomers, with such black hate in their hearts, would not die without wresting some prize, some boon, from the sleeper.\n\nAnd so it happened that one summer day, an invisible wall of energy passed over and through the exile, leaving scars that no eye could see. The blast that'd given off this radiation shook the continent, but disturbed very little of it. For most of Antarctica, it may as well never have happened.\n\nFor those exiles who'd caused the blast, the sleeper was known by a different name..."

Despite Schirmacher's best attempts to dissuade him, Mayr had still insisted on attending the flotilla's arrival in full officer's uniform, though the blistering cold of a brisk Antarctic morning was clearly starting to bite away at Mayr's stern visage. Schirmacher simply sighed and look ahead; his friend had always been a tough bastard when it came to protocol even back in '39, when neither of them had had to deal with this perpetual shit factory of an Antarctic colony, Mayr had been insistent to follow even the most stringent commands of the party.\n\nWhen a Luftwaffe official hopped out of the docked resupply ship wrapped in layers upon layers of fur, Schirmacher couldn't help but take a smug glance at his shivering superior.\n\n"Oberstleutnant Mayr and Leutnant Schirmacher I presume?" came the muffled voice of the Luftwaffe official.\n\nBehind him, men shouted to one another as the first few containers were lowered onto the jetty.\n\n"We have here the first few prototypes you are to test in Neuschwabenland, hopefully what are to be the first of many.""

Unfortunately, Rudolf couldn't even find that solace here. The fireplace crackled, emitting a heat that he desperately basked in.\n\nAs Rudolf concluded the last of his paperwork, he sighed. It was never supposed to be this way. This was the place he dreamed of throughout the war, it was the fuel that kept him going through Barbarossa. He wearily reached into his drawer and pulled a cigarette from his dwindling supply. Tonight was a special occasion, 24 years to the day since his first expedition to this wasteland. There was so much hope in his eyes back then...\n\nTo mark the anniversary, a Marlboro Red was in good order. Mayr's cigar supply ran out weeks ago, so now he smoked American cigarettes acquired during poker night. Soon enough, the only boon that this wasteland could provide would be gone.\n\nThe tobacco filled Rudolf's lungs, providing a much needed buzz that clouded his brain. Thoughts wracking his mind all day dissipated through his nose in a cloud of smoke. SS whack jobs galivanting within his territory, the OFN Administration growing bolder by the day, the worryingly small resupply shipments as of late.

Richard uniformly queued in line at the mess hall. The chef plopped slop onto his tray. He sighed at the sight of it. However, there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

Greedily filling up his cup, Richard knew the coffee helped the slop go down easier.\n\nWith his breakfast properly scarfed down with coffee, the aviator stepped into the cold once again.

Seeing if any enemy had the audacity to cross their territory.\n\nWith the ground crew giving him the all clear, Schirmacher and his copilot, Rudolf Mayr, stepped into the plane. The two sat in silence, preserving what little energy reserves they possessed. The engines roared to life, ground crews guided him down the runway. Then the silent mission began.\n\nUp in the air, Rudolf peered through his binoculars, briefly jotting down anything that caught his eye. Richard kept his eye on the prize: a 30 kilometer loop into no man's land. He never much liked looking at the ground, too much sun reflecting off the snow. Damn shame, that, he would've loved a tranquil plane ride over Aschaffenburg. Instead he was thousands of kilometers away, fighting in the legendary Operation Barbarossa.\n\nEighteen years later, Richardheinrich Schirmacher awoke in Neuschwabenland, only running on fitful episodes of sleep.

I don't like to be made the fool, but for you I can always make an exception.\n\nJudging by your last correspondence, I see that all is well in Neuschwabenland. Do give Mayr my warmest regards, and tell him to write again soon. I haven't seen the lad since '56. I digress, what is new with you, friend? I myself can barely take time out of my schedule to write to my friends. Just today I had to hound my secretary out of my office for some peace and quiet. Quite shameful, isn't it. The world is in such a hurry these days.\n\nI am sorry to end on such a bleak note. Money can't buy peace of mind, but it can buy the finest chocolate in all the Reich. Don't eat it all in one place.\n\nYour friend, Hermann Göring"\n\nErich couldn't help but smile at the letter, and savor the chocolate to boot. It was always good to hear from his friend. Though, the swiftness of the letter concerned him. Hermann had a very flexible schedule, to make time to enjoy his lavish lifestyle. It was unlike him to have such a busy schedule, and half a page? Such sparse details? It was very unlike the man to be so brief and cryptic. Something was clearly wrong, he would have to broach the subject in his return letter.\n\nOf course, this is what Schumann would have pondered if he were just one of the grunts hired to keep the lights on.

He had two sons, one in college, the other in the Fallschirmjägers. They hated each other, each one wrote letters to him. He'd read their letters to pass the time. To be honest, he agreed more with his younger son, Karl, who joined the reformist chapter of his college.

A small dot on the endless white horizon turned into a transport vehicle within a few minutes.

The uniform he adorned was covered by a stylish black wool jacket that flapped in the frozen breeze.\n\nHerbert and the SS officer stood at attention facing each other, neither one wanting to say the first word. Instead, it was Herbert's subordinates that offered the lackeys a smoke. Their commander curtly responded with, "Once the supplies are loaded."\n\nWith haste, the SS and Neuschwabisch soldiers loaded the vehicle, quickly retiring to a smoke break once the last crate was packed in. The two officers, seeing that their subordinates were chatting away, decided to engage in small talk. "Any luck with whatever the hell you guys are working on?"

It was not the only prototype weapon that had taken flight that day. Years of work and months of planning had culminated in this moment, and Schumann was attentive to every single detail: the turbulence of the flight, the altitude of the planes, even the polished brass of his Luftwaffe escorts' uniforms. Honorary Aryans or not, the Japanese could not be trusted to execute the Führer's will on their own.\n\nAn island slowly rose over the horizon and the strategic bomber banked left. Schumann's plane kept its distance, performing a circular flight path around the target. Schumann saw a hundred or more ships of all classes moored in the harbor. The G10N opened its bomb-bay doors and released a single teardrop-shaped capsule. Schumann counted. "One... two... three..." Thirty seconds later, at 11:22, all the clocks in Pearl Harbor stopped. A second sun rose over the Pacific, lifting battleships and aircraft carriers a hundred feet into the air, casting them down to the burned-white ocean floor. Nothing was spared the wrath of Schumann's creation, not even the Japanese bomber, which was enveloped in the fireball; no one had told them the true yield of their payload. A hundred thousand souls were vaporized, pulverized, or received lethal doses of radiation. Schumann had become death, destroyer of worlds.

This was the fruit of Schumann's mutually beneficial arrangement with Göring: modern electronics for use in the building of his creation. "Careful, careful!" Schumann called to the stevedores. "The contents of those boxes are worth more than your lives!"\n\nAt length the ship was fully unloaded and Schumann took account of each and every part delivered. It would be just like Göring to "forget" to include one of the more expensive components, perhaps allocating those funds for a down payment on another sports car or lavish hunting trip. This time, it seemed, Göring had come through for Schumann, and therefore Schumann would come through for Göring when the time came.\n\nAs Schumann began the long walk back to his lab, he contemplated the possibilities the Reich's technical innovations gave him. Laser rangefinding was a prototype technology that would enable precisely-timed detonation of nuclear bombs above their targets, whether civilian or military. With such precision, Schumann could now focus on increasing the yield to unimaginable levels. The possibilities were endless, so long as the materials kept coming on schedule."

Karl had gotten accepted into the University of Wien, on track to secure a highly sought-after career in academia. Albrecht, on the other hand, was pursuing an illustrious career in the Luftwaffe. He had found his place in the factionalism of the military. Anton never much cared for factionalism, but it made his son happy when he espoused the ideals of the militarists. So in turn, it made Anton happy.\n\nIn the end, he knew his boy would grow out of the petty factionalism as he climbed the ranks, those divisions melted the higher up you ascended. Anton hopped off the train of thought, now was not the time to think about the future. He was here to go fishing with his two boys, just like he had done throughout their childhood.\n\nAs for the head of the house, Anton found himself uprooted from his comfy Hungarian assignment, and instead found himself escorting a nuclear physicist to Antarctica. Apparently, some hotshot that warranted his experience and protection. Anton never much liked the cold, but maybe the lack of Russians shooting at him would change his mind. For now, though, all he had to do was cast his line, and drink Pilsners with his boys. Unfortunately, peace would not be a part of the plan. Their conversation eventually settled on politics... the most volatile of them all. It was not long before the talk of reformation came to pass. Immediately, his two boys came to blows. The boys threw down their fishing rods, opting for fisticuffs. They were going to fight like they were still god damn children! In a fit of fatherly instinct, he stood in the way of his sons, diffusing the fight. Defeated, he hollered to pack it in.\n\nThe entire ride home, they sat in silence, Anton trying to focus on the music humming from the car radio. Not even the wind ruffling through his thinning hair could make him feel better about the events that transpired.\n\n"I wanted one last fishing trip with you two, I'm going to Antarctica for God's sake! You couldn't keep your opinions to yourselves for an afternoon."\n\nExasperated, Anton let out a deep sigh and looked to his right, and to the back. His boys weren't even listening... He opted to stay silent for the rest of the car ride."

Twenty years in the public eye, however, made his nervousness imperceptible to all but the most astute. He rapped on the door to Anton Grasser's office. He waited for three long seconds for Grasser to open the door. Immediately, Anton's blue eyes peered into Schumann's soul.\n\n"Erich! What can I do for you?" The eagle-eyed patroller instantaneously sensed that Erich was wound like a clock. Impressive, it must've taken years to perfect. Too bad Anton spent as much time learning how to read people like a book. Feigning ignorance, Grasser invited Schumann into his office.\n\n"Do you want me to put some tea on? Me and the boys pooled together some marks to get the good tea from an Indian vessel that passed by. You won't regret it!"\n\nErich nodded, his mouth was drying up, but his composure was still stalwart. Despite the fact that Anton could see his act faltering ever so slightly. With the door closed, and the kettle on, Grasser returned to his seat. He knew the nuclear physicist wasn't here on a social call, but nevertheless, he pretended to listen with curiosity at Erich's words.\n\n"Well, Anton. It's more or less, what can I do for you." As he rehearsed 100 times before, Erich reached into his coat pocket and handed a letter to Grasser. Whilst reading the letter, Erich narrated his proposition.\n\n"You see, me and Hermann Göring have been in correspondence for a while now, and it has come to his attention that you have a son in the Luftwaffe. I don't know how far you are in the letter, but the gist of it is that Göring has offered a... quid pro quo. You do right by me, and Göring will do right by your boy. Give things a nudge in the right direction."\n\nAnton set down the letter and stared at the audacious scientist. He would usually have gone to Rudolf Mayr, but this offer only comes once in a lifetime, in the right place and right time. He had no choice to accept, he knew the military was bloated, and that the only way up the hierarchy was if you knew a guy. His thoughts were interrupted by the tea kettle whistling. Anton got up and turned off the stove. In pregnant silence, Anton poured two streams of hot water into old mugs from his Hungarian garrison.

Then again... it was a barren wasteland with no one around for kilometers. The nukes shipped in the first week, and detonated the second. Antarctica had two wonderful uses for the Reich now. In the end, he would get not just one test, but multiple. The well connected physicist found a literal and figurative friend in a high place. Germany's beloved uncle, the flyboy himself, Herman Göring. Schumann had been schmoozed for most of his long career, but it was in Breslau that he would find himself in the presence of the man who greenlit this whole operation.\n\nThe year? 1958. The weather? Colder than Schumann's mother-in-law. The moon-lit sky peered through french windows, conversations ensued, glasses clinked against one another, champagne fresh on the lips of everyone in attendance. All the while, Schumann made himself comfortable at the snack bar, munching on the finest shrimp the North Sea could offer. He had given his posse the slip and needed the alone time to quell his groaning belly. That was when fate reunited him with a man he hadn't seen in a decade. Lo and behold, an unknown hand was reaching for the same shrimp Erich was eyeing. Being courteous, he offered the shrimp without seeing who's hand it belonged to. Only to see Germany's uncle, with a kind smile and a yearning hand.\n\n"Let me guess, finding solace at the shrimp table?" Hermann jested, trying to create banter.\n\n"I suppose so, Uncle Göring. Giving my friends the slip, more like." Schumann replied, smirking as he invoked the endearing nickname.\n\n"Well, it's a pleasure to see you again." Göring leaned into Schumann's ear, "I must admit, I'm hiding out from my mates too." As he leaned back out, Göring kept the flame of conversation alight. "I haven't seen you since the victory parade in Germania... back when it was called Berlin. Come, let's talk more, they're serving food soon."\n\nThe two spent the rest of the night discussing all sorts of topics on the frigid balcony. From sports stars to sports cars, a garden variety of topics cycled through their conversation until the banquet started tapering out. Without the cover of a crowd, their respective yes-men finally found where they'd been hiding out. With a quick handshake, the two parted ways, sure that they would be meeting again soon."

Hermann told of his first moments in the air with a comrade in arms during the first World War before getting to his main topic.\n\n"Tell me... this is a bit of a sensitive question, but what do you see as the future of the Reich?" Göring already knew the answer. The flyboy just wanted to hear it from the horse's mouth.\n\n"I see a future where our nation is guided by qualified individuals, not party stooges," Feigning surprise, Göring shot up in his seat.\n\n"We are akin, you and I Herr Schumann, in fact, that was why I invited you here today. You see, I've begun to assemble a... clique if you will, of like-minded individuals from all across German society, who want to give professionals, the men of science, the men of progress, such as yourself, a larger say in running things."\n\n"Herr Schumann, you're an intelligent man, and I've no doubt that you are aware of what will happen when the beloved Führer passes on to the next life. It will not be pretty, a civil war we predict. And so I want you to be far away when that happens. Tell me, have you ever been to Antarctica?"\n\n"No, but-"\n\n"I believe there are things on that frozen continent that can benefit us both. You see, colonization didn't work there... far too cold, but it has found a new purpose as an aeronautics research facility. Oberstleutnant Rudolf Mayr, one of mine, he's gone soft. The man calls himself a pilot but he's cozying up to Bormann and that party line you spoke so bitterly of. He hasn't the gumption to change a damn thing. They of course would not be opposed to bringing on an esteemed scientist such as yourself."\n\nSchumann grinned, the gears of his mind whirring already. Imagine all the nuclear tests, hydrogen bombs, he'd have a damn field day, every day! Unfortunately, Göring interrupted such thoughts.

The walk to the secret meeting area was not a warm summer stroll. He'd been having secret meetings for the past month. The weapons were nice, but what good were high-grade weapons with no hands to wield them? Erich proposed a very unusual 'refer a friend' system that attracted alienated officers and soldiers who stood to gain a lot from a militarist takeover. Of course, the chance of a snitch increased every time a friend told a friend, but recruitment was going to be cut off at this meeting. They had the manpower necessary for their putsch... when the orders came from the flyboy, they would be ready.\n\nTaking a sip from his lowball glass of whiskey, an unusual thought crossed his mind.\n\n"Are you sure about this?"\n\nMost often, Erich heard this from the officers he conspired with, but never from himself. Of course, he had a laundry list of excuses.\n\n"The militarists are the only ones with the gall to fix the issues plaguing the Reich."\n\n"If the creator of the atom bomb believes in Herr Göring, wouldn't you?"\n\nUnfortunately, Erich had few motives to convince himself with, other than Göring's promise of a better future for the Reich... One where his investments in IG Farben would pay off. A rather generous birthday present of 5,000 shares by the CEO Hermann Josef Abs. Maybe his motivations weren't solely based on concern for the fatherland but rather some... no, a lot of personal gains too.\n\nGlancing down at his Junghans watch... a present from Ernst von Siemens.

Beyond the dock, lay a placid night sky, with an equally calm ocean to accompany it. It was always so easy for him to lose himself looking at the moonlit ocean.\n\nIn an effort to get chummy with the seamen, Ryker offered smokes to the weary sailors. Who gladly accepted the gift. Of course, while this was happening, the foot soldier scouted for a certain Kriegsmarine officer, best described to have a Prussian mustache and a stiff upper lip. While Ryker smoked with a tattooed sailor, he spotted a man who fit the description. As to be expected, he was barking orders to sailors scurrying to and fro. Ryker excused himself and walked to the sailor. Who promptly yelled at him before he could open his mouth.\n\n"Get back to your post, and put that cigarette out!" Ryker, momentarily stunned by the assumption of his identity, forgot the codeword. The sailor, affronted by the stagnant man in front of him, raised his arms to yell some more, but Schumann stepped in front of Ryker to quell the sailor.\n\n"Now, now, that's no way to treat a colleague of ours. Dear old friends remember Vienna, don't we?" Upon recognizing the phrase, the sailor's eyes widened, and a smile crept across his greying whiskers.\n\n"Of course, Herr Schumann, please accept my sincerest apologies, your delivery will be with you shortly." The sailor turned to Ryker and spoke in a hushed tone to the irate soldier. "As for you... remember the damn code next time, now get out of my sight."\n\nThe two turned and walked down the gangplank.

His prim desk, barren save for Göring's letter.\n\nHe knew everyone was making their moves, almost every Fallschirmjäger division went AWOL for a week, only to resurface in Breslau, the hub of Göring and his militarists.

Reluctantly, I've mobilized for defense. My loyal airforce beckons the call, but I have yet to receive an assurance of loyalty from Rudolf Mayr."\n\nErich scoffed, this was clearly the pretense he was meant to use for his putsch. It was flimsy at best, and treason at worst, but he had nothing better.\n\n"My friend, I wish it didn't have to come to this.

Jet-A-1, the fuel most of the Einheitspakt uses, will freeze below -47C, well above the average temperature on the continent but low enough that we may be able to fly with minimal modifications on the coast. Doing our test inland will mean we need to make more extensive modifications to the plane so that it can survive the colder climate, and we'll need to pull from our Jet-B reserve to avoid freezing before the engines get hot.

Mayr was the calm eye of a technological storm; teams of engineers bustled around him, prepping the wind tunnel. The P.1110 series would render every single fighter, bomber, and reconnaissance plane Mayr and his comrades had flown and died in during the war archaic. There's something sad about that, Mayr thought, but he felt an undeniable thrill; the men who would take to the skies in this sleek, eerie craft would make mincemeat of any bomber squadron, American or Japanese, they met in battle.\n\nThe ingenious aspect of the P.1110/I was that beneath its metallic skin was a mostly-wooden skeleton. This cheapened production costs and made the craft lighter, a welcome reprieve for the Luftwaffe's coffers and a boon to its global prestige. The interceptor also possessed something never seen before in aviation history: an annular air intake that wrapped around the hull like a belt. The entire rear half of the plane was nothing but a giant engine. This was to reduce drag and increase top speed, but no one knew for sure if a wooden airframe could survive velocity in excess of nine-hundred kilometres per hour. The designers assured Mayr that such a thing was possible, and that if mass-produced, this fighter would grant the Luftwaffe unparalleled air interdiction and superiority.\n\nAt least, in theory, so long as the tests went according to plan.\n\nThe chief engineer approached Mayr. "The wind tunnel is at idle," he said. "We can either gradually ramp up the power, which will result in a longer test and draw more heavily on our energy resources. Or, we can set the tunnel to maximum and see what the breaking point of the craft is, which will result in a shorter test but cost less energy. What is your decision, sir?""

"Hmm?"\n\n"If I'm understanding this correctly, using your new mechanism, the output of the engine changes drastically when exposed to rapidly-shifting air temperatures - something the plane will certainly be subjected to during flight. Sudden changes in velocity during a combat engagement would be deadly. I don't want our pilots to be fighting their own aircraft at the same time they're trying to fight an enemy."\n\nThe engineers were abashed. As usual, they failed to take into account the experience of the man in the cockpit.\n\nMayr shuffled the papers together. "Remove air temperature as a variable to your fuel regulator.

It'd be a miracle if he ever walked again.\n\nThe grim reality of test flight was that someone had to be first; someone had to climb into the cockpit, start the engine, and make the first flight. This was true of every aircraft since the Wright Brothers. In the age of the jet-powered airplane, these first flights often ended in fire and pain.\n\nThe engineers could draft their schematics and crunch the numbers, but at the end of the day, it was a Luftwaffe airman who had to discover the capabilities of the airframe - a fact Mayr and his comrades from the war were quite familiar with. No one knew how the P.1110 interceptor would behave in cold weather flight. This first flight, which had ended in a near-fatal crash, had revealed a problem with the jet's annular intake: it had a tendency to freeze shut, starving the engine of air, causing a flameout, after which the plane became nothing more than a ten-thousand pound paperweight.\n\nNow Mayr faced a critical decision. The design team informed him that it would be possible to refit the existing airframe with frost-resistant materials and antifreeze mechanisms around the annular intake. It would cost a great deal of raw materials to experiment with and find the best combination of alloys and metals for the intakes.

Rather than directly controlling the mechanics of an aircraft, a pilot's commands were translated into electrical signals that were in turn interpreted by processors that controlled the ailerons, elevators, and rudder. The rationale for this system was that the plane was too fast for the reactions of a pilot, so some amount of computerization was necessary.\n\nComputerization of mechanical systems was not a new idea to the Reich's scientists, especially after Unternehmen Seelöwe and the seizure of Bletchley Park.

The obliteration of Pearl Harbor by the fiery rays of Schumann's creation had negated the bomber's name; the Horten Ho XVIII never had a chance to fulfill its purpose. Now, it was being given new life.\n\nThis was, in many ways, the age of the high-altitude strategic bomber. The Reich lacked a tool that could compete in this arena effectively.

The Luftwaffe had deemed it too unwieldy, and in some ways, overqualified, for the terror bombing of Russian serfs or Afrikan tribesmen. But the bomber had advantages no other modern strategic bomber possessed: it flew extremely high, it was fuel-efficient, could theoretically carry a nuclear payload, and could accomplish all this under a cloak of stealth.\n\nBeimler and Pohl regarded the giant aircraft filling the center of their hangar.

I'm pleased to report that the Horten Ho 229 winterization project has been a success. Despite our limited resources and the tenuous military situation in Antarctica, our team has managed to fulfill all specified improvements. The Luftwaffe's request for a feasibility assessment of Göring's 3x1000 has proven that this airframe is simply incapable of meeting the simultaneous requirements speed, range, and payload. I would like to add that our team made every effort to achieve these requirements, and I wholeheartedly submit them for commendation.\n\nIf this aircraft is deployed in its intended capacity against the remaining Russian industrial centers, I believe the Luftwaffe will be fully satisfied with the destructive results.\n\nFinally, I would like to request that you personally look into the possibility of getting us greater funding and material resources. If our scientists could accomplish the winterization project with what they've been given thus far, imagine what they could do if all their needs were met by the Reich."

"Well, we've achieved some improvement in the airframe's capability in cold weather. It could fly short missions over Russia's western industrial centers, but any penetration beyond the Urals into Siberia would be impossible. Additionally, any missions over the Arctic to contest Alaskan and Canadian airspace would be... inadvisable. Essentially what we have is a slightly-upgraded version of last decade's jet. It's not competitive with modern machines. I wouldn't even call it a modern aircraft."\n\nMayr nodded as if he expected the answer. "That's pretty much what I thought."\n\n"Perhaps if you'd allocated more resources to the program, or managed our finite supplies better, our scientists would have been able to accomplish more."\n\nMayr went red in the face and bit his cheek to avoid an explosion of expletives. "You understand as well as I, Doktor, where we stand in the Reich's priorities. Colonial garrisons in Ostland or Ukraine have a better chance of getting supplies than we do."\n\nSchumann shrugged.

The Union had been destroyed two decades ago, yet these raiders didn't seem to get the memo. They surged across the border in old T-34s, scavenging gasoline, food, and whatever passed for luxury goods in Reichskommissariat Moskowien.\n\nFor many months, the meager Heer garrisons in the region had had no way to rapidly respond to the armored raiders. Now, thanks to a gift from the Luftwaffe, they did. Apparently, from what Pfeiffer could gather, a modernization program for the MBB Bo 115 anti-tank helicopter had failed in the Reich's Antarctic colony of Neuschwabenland, and the remaining models had been placed in Pfeiffer's care.\n\nHe'd fallen in love with the machines instantly. They were fast, maneuverable, and relatively fuel-efficient; a notable trait in the resource-strapped, Godforsaken Reichskommissariat. Seventeen notches on Pfeiffer's fuselage marked the kills he'd gotten in the last month since the helicopters arrived. The Gorky raiders didn't know what hit them. The irony was fitting: obsolete tech destroying obsolete tech; the past recycling itself.\n\nThe radio crackled. "The untermensch are at it again," base said. "Want a few more notches on your hull? We have reports of a column of tanks crossing the Gorky border, supported by marching infantry."\n\nPfeiffer removed the safeties on his old anti-tank rockets. "Yes please.""

Grecian pillars flanked him as he made his way to the balcony in full view of the assembled crowds. He stepped up to a microphone.\n\n"Today," he said, "you will bear witness to the wonders of Aryan technological supremacy. Our scientists at the South Pole have engineered a new helicopter with which we will lay waste to our enemies and ensure the preservation of our Thousand Year Reich."\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and cries of Sieg Heil. A wing of newly-modernized MBB Bo 115 tank-killers dove out of the sky above the Volkshalle, flying in a chevron formation. The helicopter leading the formation pulled out of the dive at the last moment to perform a loop, to the delight of the crowds. For twenty minutes, the aircraft displayed the power of German engineering.\n\nGöring was impressed with what Rudolf Mayr and his team had accomplished. It seemed to him that the resource expenditure in Neuschwabenland was not only worth it, but necessary to maintain an edge in coming conflicts. It was a shame they couldn't show the crowds the destructive potential of the weapons, but Göring had a feeling that in due time, they'd witness it firsthand."

Oh well, Dr. Sauer supposed, no need to break the bad news to him all at once. "Quit whining, I'm almost done here." Sauer sighed as his patient continued to grumble nevertheless. "There. Your bones will recover with time, just don't try to walk or anything like that until you receive permission from a doctor."\n\n"Yeah, yeah," The other man reluctantly agreed, looking at his legs with clear discomfort. Sauer wondered if, somehow, the man knew deep down how severe his injury was. "Hey, Doktor, you have any cigs?"\n\n"Normally I'd say no, but... I think in this case you've more than earned one. Here," Dr. Sauer took a cigarette from his personal carton, then offered his patient a light. He never had been much one to share, but it was hard not to sympathize with a man who might have just seen the end of his career."

 antarctica_aag_testing.420.desc:0 ""You ready, Krause?"\n\n"Ready as I'll ever be, Becker." Oberleutnant Johann Krause and Leutnant Wilhelm Becker had been given an important mission for the good of the technological testing: in an MBB Bo 115 helicopter, they were to attempt both a dangerous landing and risky take off from an icy slope nearby Schirmacher Station, a feat that would test not only the build of the helicopter but their own piloting skills to the extreme. Not that this, or the scientific importance of their mission, concerned either of them in the slightest; they were here for the thrill of the risk itself, the desire to prove their abilities as pilots.\n\nFrom high in the air, the two began a steep, slow descent onto the ice that pushed their expertise to the limit. Over the course of what was in all likelihood just a minute but felt like far longer, they touched down onto the slope, their landing successful.\n\nNow came the hardest part.\n\n"Taking off in three, two, one..." Krause muttered, before he and his copilot began working together to make the helicopter take off from this precarious, sloping position. The snow flurried all around them, making it difficult to differentiate ground from sky; Becker thought he remembered the scientists referring to this as 'whiteout conditions'. Making the situation worse was the worry of ice and snow buildup in critical systems of the helicopter; they had made thoroughly sure all important systems were as clean as could be before flight, but such buildup could occur even mid-flight in the conditions of Antarctica. They just had to hope this helicopter had been built well enough to resist the buildup of ice, at least for the duration of their flight.\n\nAfter a false start, where Krause and Becker had to bring the helicopter back down as Krause let out a string of swears, they at last managed to bring their helicopter high up and begin the short journey back to base. Becker cheered and clapped Krause on the back, and despite his initial frustration even Krause had to crack a smile, from both excitement and relief."

"Steady, steady... alright, be careful aiming Becker. We want to make every shot count." Krause, who remained in the pilot's seat, reminded his copilot who nodded in return.\n\n"Understood, you can count on me."\n\nBefore them lay the greatest test the new anti-tank weaponry had faced so far: an old Panther tank, left behind from the war, reinforced by scrap metal welded to its already unusually thick armor plating. After taking a few moments to line up the shot with a perceived weak point in the armor, Becker fired... only for the projectile to fall just short of the Panther, missing entirely. After Becker announced this, Krause frowned. "Unfortunate, but there's nothing to be done about it. I'll bring us a little closer."\n\nAfter Krause did so, Becker again lined up his shot and fired, this time dealing heavy damage to the Panther in spite of its heavy, reinforced plating. Becker let out a cheer and laughed while Krause offered a smile, but in his mind the Overleutnant could not help but worry that the range on this weaponry was much too short for comfort."

More specifically, a single engine test flight in severe turbulence. Being a flying wing design, it could theoretically glide vast distances given the right conditions. The forecast for today called for high headwinds. The bomber was already bucking so much Pohl could taste his lunch, bratwurst and sauerkraut.\n\n"All right," said the pilot, "cutting engines in three, two, one... cutoff!" The plane grew quieter as five of the six jet engines shut down. The low whine of the remaining one was distant. At first the aircraft was steady, but then the wind picked up and it began jostling Pohl around in his seat. He knew all that stood before them and the icy Atlantic was a few feet of metal and the pilot at the controls. "She handles well, doesn't she, Herr Doktor?" the pilot laughed.\n\nPohl was too busy trying not to throw up to give much input. He quickly wrote down what he saw on the instruments between dry heaves. Over the course of an hour, they lost very little altitude and had maintained an acceptable speed. This was an impressive aeronautical accomplishment in the infamous Antarctic airspace.

After the nine-hour-long flight, he was less certain about the idea than he had been on the tarmac, but he had been assured that Schenck's forces were ready on the ground should anything go awry.\n\nThe Horten's radio crackled to life, the pilot a couple dozen meters above him coordinating the process. "Our boom operator is ready to attach the boom with your tank, is everything ready on your end?"\n\n"Yep, whenever you're ready," Hauke responded, his voice sounding dry and stiff after hours of silence.\n\nThrough a specially installed camera for monitoring the boom, Hauke observed the careful attachment of the planes. His fuel meter, previously nearly empty, started increasing. "It looks like it's working on my end."\n\n"Excellent!

It looked nothing like the reconnaissance pictures from that year. The team navigated a labyrinth of icy crevasses and sastrugi sharp enough to carve steel. Geiger counters ticked as the team took readings. Schumann was eager to see how far the radiation levels had fallen. They would need to take ice core samples from ground zero; katabatic winds and surging ice floes would've already dispersed surface radiation, muddling superficial observations.\n\nAs boots crunched over dense snow, Schumann pondered the many ways he could improve his invention.

The bomb was his life's work.\n\nHe'd joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party in 1933, eager to provide his academic expertise to the Reich. He had spent years guiding a team of researchers as Plenipotentiary for High Explosives and it had been Schumann who had made the breakthrough discovery of nuclear fission.\n\nToday in Neuschwabenland, his objective was the same as it had always been: build a better, and more importantly, bigger, bomb. Precision was important, even in as indiscriminate a weapon as a nuclear warhead, perhaps especially in that case. Through the use of modern circuitry, the detonation of a nuclear weapon could be refined to the millisecond, giving its user the most accurate and responsive weapon possible. Whether the weapon be air-burst or contact-detonated, it would be reliable and consistent."

It has a tendency to fry any complex electrical systems or batteries within its radius, which is far greater than that of the explosion which created it. The dispersion of the pulse itself is greatly enhanced by a mid-air detonation over the target."\n\n"So even if a machine isn't destroyed by the blast, it could still be rendered inoperable."\n\n"Precisely. In a combat scenario, we would detonate a single, perhaps multiple, warheads high above a target, say Washington D.C. The EMP would knock out command and control systems and make countermeasures difficult. Then we would follow up with another salvo, then another, until the job was done," He gestured at the large chamber dominating the lab, "What I wanted to show you today was that we can create electronic equipment that would withstand the pulse and continue to function. This chamber replicates the pulse, and there's an operating circuit board inside," He gestured towards a big red button, "Mayr, would you like to do the honours?"\n\nMayr laughed, "Delighted," He pushed the button.

Today's test was perhaps of a less grandiose nature compared to those that would inevitably follow, but it was no less important. When nuclear fission had first been weaponized by Schumann and the Uranverein, it was in the form of a relatively small yield bomb. That small yield had laid waste to the US Pacific fleet at anchor, proving that nuclear technology was deadly on any scale.\n\nThe scale today would be a tactical nuclear artillery test. The Heer had requested that the Strategische Raketenwaffeneinheit look into the development of a low-yield tactical nuclear weapon which could be fired from some form of artillery piece. The test would involve a recoilless smoothbore gun not dissimilar to the recently-introduced American M-29 Davy Crockett weapon system.\n\nIt looks like something out of a pulp comic, thought Schumann, yet he knew that the device was capable of great destruction, in the right hands. All of the Reich's many services vied constantly to introduce more nuclear capability into their ranks. On this occasion, the Heer would get their weapons test. In the future, they might not be so fortunate."

 antarctica_aag_nuclear.50.desc:0 "Close air support had been a staple of the Wehrmacht's combat doctrine since the victories of the Second World War. Closely integrated Luftwaffe planes delivered death to the opponents of the Panzer formations, helping to secure ultimate victory. The Luftwaffe, in the Atomic Age, wanted to know how feasible it would be to use low-yield tactical nuclear bombs to support an armored thrust.\n\nNeedless to say, this operation would be extremely risky for both the aircraft deploying the weapon and the friendly formations below. To that end, precision was paramount. Schumann created a range with sensors marked as friendlies and enemies to measure heat, explosive force, and radiation in order to see how close an ally could be before they were in danger of becoming collateral damage, thus weakening the Wehrmacht's offensive potential. The Horten 229 that would deploy the bomb was similarly rigged with sensors; the pilots who dropped experimental atomic bombs were not safe from their own weapons, they would have to veer up, and fast.\n\nSchumann heard the engine of the 229 as it roared overhead. It was time to see if there was a place for the atom in maneuver warfare. The 229 flew over the range and released its payload. The bomb accurately hit the mock enemy target and detonated, incinerating a fake formation. The heat and kinetic impact on friendly forces was tolerable. However, further studies on how much radiation a soldier in an armored vehicle ought to take should be considered."

While this weapon system had become the primary strategic deterrent, it was not the only implement in their arsenal.\n\nThe experiment Schumann was tasked with today would be the testing of a short-range ballistic missile which could be used on a theater level. This missile would help annihilate enemy bastions and military infrastructure without putting a single man at risk. At least, not one of ours, Schumann thought. Ideally the missile would be impossible to intercept, flying too low and too fast to be stopped by any countermeasure. Today the target would have no chance of resisting, seeing as it was a glacier six hundred kilometers into the Antarctic wastes south of Schirmacher.\n\nSchumann watched with admiration as rocket technology originally designed by his pupil, Werner von Braun, took to the skies to deliver his nuclear solution."

The radiation shielding, the Geiger counters, all the safety equipment, it takes up as much space in a ship as our aircraft materials combined. I could have a new prototype brought here for the same space as the bit of uranium you want to transport."\n\n"As I was saying," said Schumann, "nuclear weapons are the true muscle of the Reich. They have more applications than your aircraft. They are the future."\n\n"Maybe you're right, but what you propose means sacrificing a shipment of food that our men will need at some point. You won't even have a place to test your devices if we don't keep the men healthy."\n\nSchumann, ever a political animal, knew when to abandon a futile argument. He smiled, "Very well.

Ever since the early days of the Uranverein, Schumann had contemplated how to make the strongest explosion possible.\n\nHere in Antarctica, he would take the first step towards his vision. He knew however that to take that first step, the detonation of a prototype, he would have to acquire an excess of U-235, and that would not be easy. But as it so happened, being on the ground floor of nuclear innovation involved friends in high places.\n\nThere was a mine in Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika called Shinkolobwe. Located in the south of the administration, Schumann knew it possessed immense reserves of Uranium and had even, at one point, supplied it to the parallel American nuclear program when it was controlled by the Allies. Schumann had already received his allotment of uranium for the year, but that would not stop him.

Amidst the rusted destroyers and supply ships from Kerguelen, the whaler seemed out of place - practical and sturdy, yet indifferent to the Antarctic desolation.\n\n"Captain Karlsen!" Schumann shouted, spotting the old whaler captain inspecting the last crates of oil being loaded onto the ship. The captain turned, a pipe clenched in his teeth. "Herr Schumann," Karlsen said with a thick Norwegian accent. "You look colder than the ice itself. What brings you here?"\n\nSchumann stepped closer, lowering his voice as he handed the letter to Karlsen. "This must reach Bouvet Island without delay. From there, it will be sent to Norway. Understood?" Karlsen glanced at the envelope and slipped it into his coat, shrugging. "An odd route. What are you planning, Herr Schumann?" he asked with a smirk.\n\nSchumann's gaze hardened. "You're paid to sail the ship, not to ask questions." The captain chuckled and waved his hand, "Fair enough." He then turned toward the ship and called to his crew, "Let's get going!"\n\nAs the Nordlys' engines roared to life and the ship faded into the fog, Schumann watched it go. The letter was addressed to an old colleague, Hans Suess. It consisted of a small favor - to pull strings and secure more fissile material from the Reich's uranium stockpile.

When dealing with academics, Schumann found a crisp military uniform inspired confidence in his underlings and a modicum of fear. In the presence of generals, a professorial robe communicated intelligence and a non-confrontational aspect, good for setting them at ease.\n\nToday was an auspicious one. It was the first nuclear test in Neuschwabenland since December of 1961.

They would understand when the fury of a second sun lit up the Antarctic expanse. They would understand that all their sacrifices, all their travails, were worth it in the end, for the security of the Reich.

It was better than thinking about the situation he now found himself at the helm of.\n\nHe stood at the end of the longest pier of Schirmacher Base, remembering the last Kriegsmarine ships sailing towards the horizon. Shortly after the conflict had begun in Germany proper, Karl Dönitz had declared a general recall to all fleets in the German navy. The ships of the farthest German port were to make their way across the Atlantic, through the Straits of Gibraltar, past the Bosphorus, to dock in the great port of Theoderichshafen.\n\nThis was all well and good for the captains in Antarctica, but the garrison was being left to their own devices, alone and abandoned at the end of the world. Mayr ordered fervently that the captains would lobby Dönitz to send some supplies south, but it was ultimately a futile effort - he knew the admiral would have greater concerns to deal with in Ukraine.\n\nSo, Mayr thought, what now? Neuschwabenland found itself in a state of utmost emergency. He was already running a tight ship, and it had just gotten a hell of a lot tighter. Without appropriate use of resources, the territory's future would consist of a short period of suffering, and then complete and utter silence on the endless snowy wastes.\n\nMayr drew himself up, wrapping his coat close, his eyes set determinedly as he turned back to base.

Already researchers have become delirious, wandering out in the cold or catatonic in the shelters. In the shrinking nights, men report sights of ships on the horizon, but cooler heads say that these are just the dim lights of faraway stars. Scavenging attempts have been made on penguins and local fauna, but to describe these food sources as inadequate would be a vast overstatement - scaling hunting operations to a sustainable scale lies far in the future, if it is possible at all.\n\nEven before the base starves, Neuschwabenland may be consumed by the ice. To sustain livable conditions in the ever-present cold, the base burns through an ever-dwindling supply of gasoline. The first day after the Kriegsmarine left, Mayr instituted heat rationing: 12 hours of power a day. Then it became 10, then 8, then 6. Those with less fat and muscle to burn may not be able to survive under these conditions, as their bodies burn what few calories they receive on bodily functions.

Home, home, the sailor's heart called, the sweet grasses and the neon glow of the cities, the freshwater rivers, and the warm air of the Bavarian hills - home.\n\n"Eine Reise in den Norden ist für andre schick und fein - Doch zwei kleine Deutschlander möchten gern zuhause sein..." For some a Northern journey is all cool and fine - but two little Germans have home on the mind. Schumann thought of his distant family, drawing a long, shuddering breath.\n\n"O Anna, Emilia, wenn wir uns einmal wiedersehn - O Anna, Emilia, dann wird es wieder schön." Oh, Anna and Emilia - if we get to see each other again, won't it be wonderful?\n\nA long, shrill whistle broke the silence of the outpost. Schumann wiped away the tear stains on his coveralls and rose to see the incredible sight of the Kriegsmarineflagg - and below it, beautifully ugly German steel and iron. To his left and right men ran amok, cheering and sobbing at the sight of relief. Schumann could only clutch his guitar, thanking a silent God and whispering songs of home to the air."

"Do you ever wonder why we were consigned to this God forsaken wasteland?" he pondered, turning to face his shift partner Konrad Scwarzkopf.

Coffee, tea and all things caffeinated, key to keeping the men sharp and the work exemplary.\n\nHowever on this particular occasion a very different sort of parcel caught the eye of the men, one which would indeed keep them sharp and their work exemplary, among other things.

There was finally enough of a lull in the hoots and hollers for Schumann to commandeer the room once more.\n\n"That is why we are going to request the resignation of Rudolf Mayr!

At first, he suspected an aloof patrolman made a wrong turn and heard screaming coming from his room.\n\nHis suspicions were laid to rest when the figure charged at his desk. Knife out, intent deadly. Grabbing the nearest blunt object in his vicinity, he lunged at the intruder. Screaming as his paperweight made contact with their skull. In his underwear, the old man mercilessly bashed the intruder. My god, he hadn't felt this alive since his days in the Weltkrieg charging at Tommy's trenches.\n\nBy the time he came to the realization of what happened, Ernst was covered in blood, the intruder lay in a bloody pulp on the ground, and his secretary sat quivering in the corner. Ernst hastily dressed in his nightgown. Before he would go to warn the others, Ernst had a final request from his secretary."

Plus his squadmates, did they even realize how loud they were? Unable to ignore the squeaky boots and hum of the lights, Herbert was a rubber band about to snap. Turning to Fritz, the soldier closest to him, he barely muttered, "I'm taking a piss," before skulking outside.\n\nThe cold air alongside a night sky soothed him immediately. So much so that he removed his hat to feel the frosty air. The stimuli wracking his senses faded away, and he felt as if his head was above water... It was the only relief he would get to experience all night. The floodlights illuminating the facility went dark, his relief transitioned into alarm. Fight or flight weighed heavy. Then, out of the darkness, a figure clad in black, silent as the night emerged. He chose to fight, despite being on in years, Herbie was still sharp as a fox.\n\nArmed with years of martial arts, he parried the opening attack. His assailants' knife was embedded into the aluminum siding of the outpost. Countering, Herbert swept his opponent's leg, knocking him to the snow. Swiftly, Freitag drew his blade. Tackling his opponent, and angry at the attempt on his life, Herbert plunged the dagger into the neck of the foe.\n\nHis assaulter expired immediately. Wasting no time, he sprinted inside. Whoever attacked him wasn't alone. The lights inside were functional, but that was the only boon awaiting him. Strewn about in every which way were his comrades and attackers, and an unnerving quantity of blood. Nobody screamed, he only heard whimpering from Fritz. "Herbert!" He coughed through mouthfuls of blood. It was too late for the boy. Before that happened, though, Fritz had something to say.\n\n"Schutz... Staffel," Herbert wanted to be surprised, but deep down knew this was always a possibility. All he could do is hold Fritz's hand as he moved on to the next life. The first thing to go for Fritz was his hearing, he couldn't hear Herbert's pleas to keep his eyes open. Then, his vision faded, and he saw a visage of his dad. His last thoughts were simple. His parents, his sister, and then nothing."

Together, they traversed the chaos of Schirmacher Station, en route to a base of operations. As far as they were aware, the loyalists were bunching together, coherently countering the chaotic coup d'etat. Now they had to settle in for a prolonged conflict.\n\nIt's quiet... too quiet. Erich thought to himself. He was about to speak his mind, but Grasser raised his left hand and closed his fist. The small group stopped in its tracks. They were flanked by buildings, in one of the only alleyways of Schirmacher Station. It was an unspoken rule that you wouldn't interrupt a soldier if they went here to smoke a certain illicit substance. Die Grüne Spur is what they dubbed it. The Green Lane.\n\nTwo soldiers walked backward, guns aimed where they first entered. Two marched in front with Grasser. Erich tiptoed in the middle. Unfortunately, the escort didn't account for the loyalists gathered on the rooftops. Instantaneously, barrels were aimed at each other. The two factions yelling obscenities to each other. Then, silence fell as Richard Schirmacher stepped forth, in his suave Luftwaffe garb.\n\nSchirmacher sat down on the rooftop and popped a cigarette. He inhaled a liberal amount of smoke then let out a sigh along with the smoke.\n\n"I thought higher of you two," He took another puff of smoke, "It's disappointing really, letting the factionalism get to you. Follow me out of the alley, Mayr wants a word."\n\nThe soldiers in the Green Lane, dejected at the sudden turning of the tables, complied with the men above. It was time for a showdown.\n\nThe plotters exited the alley. Unbeknownst to Richard, he just saved all of their lives.

Two dead men, one of his own, the other an SS assailant lay on top of each other. Both bled the same red. He gingerly stepped over the corpses, embarking on the snowmobile. The humming of the engine disturbed the eerie silence, and the lone soldier rode at full speed towards Schirmacher Station.\n\nWhen the initial shock dissipated, Freitag's mind replayed Fritz's final moments. The look on the young man's face as he closed his eyes for the final time. Why had he lived and Fritz had not? Why had he been given the chance to grow old while Fritz was dead at twenty? He shuddered at the thought of one of his children or grandchildren dying so young. Herbert had lived a good life, a full life, Fritz had barely started his. I guess this is what loyalty to the Reich gets you, a knife in the gut by your fellow countrymen.\n\nThe lights of Schirmacher Station shone brightly in the distance. Thank God, thought Freitag, maybe they had already mounted a successful defense. He dared to dream, that was until he got within one hundred meters of the base. The SS were lighting buildings ablaze, and picking off soldiers caught alone.\n\nFreitag always knew there was something wrong with these guys. He thought back to the West Russian War. They were thugs by nature, his division came with an SS detachment that would 'dispose of' enemies. His squad, fed up with the atrocities, condemned the detachment to the fate they gave to thousands of others. They dug their own grave, climbed in, and were shot. He had liked seeing them beg. No follow-up investigation was launched.\n\nThe survivor stopped his snowmobile, two Schutzstaffel were planning to breach the door to the recreational room. "Hey, Scheißfleck!" Freitag bellowed, drawing their attention. He drew his pistol and put two rounds center mass as he had trained to do his entire adult life. And as Freitag attempted to do the same to the dying man's compatriot, his pistol jammed. This did not bother Freitag, with a smile he again started the engine and roared in the direction of the SS soldier."

Four hours in the cockpit bouncing through turbulence had left them tired and sore. The weather had calmed on their way back until flying conditions were nearly perfect. Presently, they were passing through a mountain range that stood between them and Schirmacher Station.

Fires raged throughout the base and the muzzle flashes of assault rifles brightened the twilight.

"If one of us could create a distraction, the other could reach the lab and set fire to it."\n\n"What kind of distraction?"\n\nBeimler scoured the lab. In the adjoining chamber was the jet propulsion lab, filled with all manner of noisy equipment and dangerous materials. Alternatively, on the sideboard, Beimler and Pohl had just finished brewing one of the last pots of coffee left on the base. In the wrong hands - or perhaps the right hands - such a thing would be debilitating to any unlucky soldier struck by it.\n\nPohl's gaze followed Beimler's, and he too understood their options, "I could make it to the lab, make as much noise as possible."\n\nBeimler shook his head.

He descended the staircase to the test floor. As he crossed the wind tunnel in front of the engine - the turbine already starting to growl - one of the soldiers opened fire from the control room, shattering the protective glass and clipping Pohl's leg. Blood drenched his pants all the way to his shoes. He darted into the secondary control booth and locked the door.\n\nBehind him, the SS lined up on the test floor, guns trained on the booth, and shouted, "Surrender and we'll make this quick!"\n\nPohl, bleeding profusely from his femoral artery, screamed back, "It'll be quick, all right!" With one fluid motion, he stood up and spun the dial that controlled the jet engine. The turbine rose to a high scream, and the three soldiers were lifted off their feet and ceased to exist. A thick red mist squirted out the tail of the engine.\n\nPohl spat. "That's for my komrades in Antifa." He pushed away from the console and staggered through a fire door.

Beimler lifted the pot free of the burner, sharing one final glorious sip of the brew with Pohl before they sacrificed it. The SS soldier's back was still turned. Beimler and Pohl crept towards him, picking their way through the detritus of the lab. Just as they got within arm's reach of the soldier, Pohl stepped on a test tube. It crunched loudly beneath his foot.\n\nThe SS man spun and uttered his last words. "Who goes there?!" Beimler swung the pot straight at the man's face. The glass shattered, peeling the soldier's nose and cheeks off whilst the boiling coffee scalded everything else. He went down screaming. Beimler took the man's assault rifle while Pohl relieved him of his SS dagger, using it to silence the soldier with a cut to the throat. Heavy footfalls sounded in the corridor; the fallen man's comrades were returning. Without thinking, Beimler stuck the assault rifle's barrel around the corner and delivered a spray of bullets into the hallway, holding down the trigger until the clip was empty. Then, he and Pohl looked around the corner.\n\n"Nice shooting, Hans," said Pohl, looking over the bodies in the corridor. He stepped forward, cutting the soldiers' throats one by one, but as he stood over the last man, the prone soldier suddenly sat upright and buried his own SS dagger deep into Pohl's thigh. Beimler sprinted forward and smashed the man's skull with the butt of the assault rifle. The dagger slipped free from Pohl's leg, and the wounded scientist collapsed against the wall. A torrent of blood gushed from his wound. Beimler wasn't a surgeon, but he could guess Pohl's femoral artery had been sliced, and there was no doctor to hand. As Pohl's face went pale, he grasped Beimler's hands. "Do me a favor, friend: don't die here. Make it home... I'm glad to have known you." And then his hands fell from Beimler's.

The leadership of Schirmacher Station knew this couldn't last, so they set to work in Herrmann's office, formulating a plan for how to push back the SS. A cigarette hung from Mayr's mouth as he hunched over a map of Schirmacher Station. Herrmann stood in the corner. Schumann leaned against the vent, the heat warming his backside. Grasser sat on a leather chair, feet on Herrmann's desk (much to his dismay). Schirmacher leaned against the window, scouting for any SS lurking in the inky darkness. Mayr took the cigarette out of his mouth, then looked at the four men. "I've been looking at this map, and I have a plan. When I was a boy, I read of how Julius Caesar won the siege of Alesia. We form a perimeter around the base, no one gets in or out. We starve the SS out and then push in. Once the Station is secure, we drive the traitors right back to Begerheim!" After taking a long drag on his cigarette, Mayr opened the floor to suggestions. "Thoughts, gentlemen?"\n\nSchumann raised a hand. "Now listen, Rudy, I have a proposition. I know you're angry, but we can figure all that out in the morning. For now, think of me as the Erich you knew last month." Mayr, seething, gestured for Schumann to continue.

We keep doing that until Schirmacher Station and the outlying bases are clear."\n\nErnst Herrmann, decked out in his Antarctic gear, raised a hand in suggestion. "Let's put it to a vote.

Grasser had gone to work quickly organizing the remaining troops and weapons on the base and divided the station into quadrants. From there, each quadrant had been assigned to a member of Mayr's staff, and work to encircle their enemy. After a few scattered firefights, the lines had settled. Three days passed, and the SS had been funneled and quarantined into derelict habitats devoid of potable water and rations.

At least he's man enough to know he fucked up and is cleaning up after his mistakes!"\n\nErnst, on the other hand, was not in the mood. He raised his hand to Mayr, "Drop it. If you want this effort to work we need to put our differences aside and realize the true enemy is somewhere out there. Watching, waiting for us to tear each other apart!" Ernst paused to take a breath; the night took a toll on him. "We must be strong, and unified... if not for your men, for Germany. They're tearing themselves apart like god damn dogs! We have to hold together," Herrmann pulled a hunting knife from its leg holster and sat it on the table, "You two are going to bury the hatchet with a blood pact, right here, right now."\n\nErnst took Rudolf's hand, and ran the blade across his palm. As he was about to do the same to Erich, the nuclear physicist gestured for the knife. He sliced his own palm and went in for the handshake. It stung, like a thousand paper cuts, and both parties stared into each other's eyes expecting contempt. Instead, they found clarity, and knew that there was only one way out of this mess."

Seated, he took in the view of the Admiralty Mountains sprawled out in the distance.\n\nHerbert walked down the narrow halls of Schirmacher Station, answering his summons to Mayr's office. He never reached his destination. Ryker Hannemann emerged in front of him, "Let's go for a walk, Herbert," he said, gesturing in the other direction. Ryker leaned over and whispered, "Mayr found out you told your grandkid and the Kriegsmarine is dangling it over him. He needs to tie up loose ends. Leitner has orders to bury your body in a snow drift," Herbert's eyes widened upon realizing he had nearly walked into a trap.\n\nFreitag opened the can, and took in the warm aroma wafting from it. Minutes later, with a full belly and weariness overtaking him, the soldier grabbed the cooking supplies and shoved them back into the sled. Then, he pulled out a sleeping bag. Time for bed... almost.\n\nRyker and Herbert walked through the halls. They had met on the night of the assault. A bond forged in fire. The two kept walking until they reached the snowmobile depot. Many were derelict, some were collecting snow, and one was ready to go. Ryker pointed to the gear by the lockers, "You've gotta leave before Mayr gets clued in. I've got a compass, a map to McMurdo, and I talked on backchannels to an Ami that knows you're coming," Herbert could only feel gratitude for everything that Ryker did for him. As he adorned the last of his gear, Ryker shoved one last thing into his hand, "I found it in your dormitory. I thought you'd like to keep it, a memento."\n\n"Thank you, Ryker," Herbert leaned in for a hug, taking Hannemann off guard. Still, he embraced him back, "Thank you too, old man.

Alaska?"\n\nRyker went up to the postman and received the letter. The postman was never one to ask questions, but it was not every day you got a letter from America. "Got cousins there?" he inquired, Ryker responded with a rather convincing. "Yes... haven't seen them in years though."\n\nWalking away with a letter in hand, Ryker found his way to his bunk. Hannemann's distinguished service earned him a nice hole in the wall in a quiet corner of the station. Upon closing his door, the curious soldier inspected the letter.\n\nAnchorage, Alaska, a blank postcard of the small port city and the Bering Sea that was postmarked on March 24th. What could it possibly mean? Hannemann thought back to his childhood, how he would write things to his schoolmate who moved to America without the censors getting a hold of his mail. It was with invisible ink, those idiots never checked for invisible ink. Conveniently for Ryker, his room came with a small stove. Turning it on, the dingy stove made a tick tick tick noise until a blue flame roared to life.\n\nRyker gingerly held the postcard over the flame. Sure enough, text started to appear in the blank space designated for letters. He smiled and shut the flame off once all the text had been exposed. Then he sat on his cot, and read the letter.\n\n"Dear Ryker,\n\nThank you for all the help, Anchorage is a beautiful place, you should visit sometime.

Ten Abwehr recruits, one grizzled field agent, and a long day of training lay ahead. Martin Leitner had seen it all, Thunder Bay to Thessaloniki, Sao Paulo to Soweto, Omsk to Osaka. Now, he had checked the final continent off the list: Antarctica. He, however, would not be spying, but rather training the pick of the graduating class.\n\n"First of all, I would like to welcome you to Neuschwabenland, second of all, I want you to drop and give me 20... no... 50."\n\nThe recruits dropped to the frozen tarmac. While the soldiers toiled away, Martin paced in between the lines of recruits. Whilst speaking, he admired the great metal beasts that rested on the tarmac. The Reich's science surely was something to behold, huh.\n\n"I graduated with ten recruits just like you. Seven of them are dead, two of them are in prison, one run by the Kempatai, and the other by the CIA. I, of course, am standing right here. Now you might be asking, why is it that I'm bossing you around while my classmates are dead or worse?"\n\nMartin waited for a wise guy to speak up, but to his surprise, the recruits kept quiet. Smart kids, they might fare better than his buddies. The air hung with a strange stillness, and the view outside of the hangar was a sight to behold. He felt guilty to break the silence with his reverberated voice.\n\n"It's because I followed my training. You might be asking, 'is that it?' The answer is yes. Everything I teach you over these next three months WILL save your life. If you go into a mission thinking the Fatherland will rescue you if anything goes awry, they won't. The CIA agent tailing you knows that Washington isn't going to rescue him either. In the moment, it's you or him, you may think about his family, his kids, his mother. Well, he knows the risks, and so do you. My friends all hesitated, I did not."\n\nMartin's spiel was over, now it was time for the real training to begin.

His white squadmate sits next to him, they share a smoke and start talking about home, Dar es Salaam. It is where they were born, and where they intend to die. Upon finishing the smoke, the white soldier bids farewell, in his hand, a briefcase he had not possessed before he sat down.\n\nIn the halls of Schirmacher base, heat emanates from the ventilation system. Ryker Hannemann basks in the warmth whilst sauntering to Ernst Herrmann's office. The door is wide open. Ernst ushers the private inside.

The ship he was on was part of a small patrol force scouting the Antarctic coast, searching for any notable reconnaissance, and defending the German scrap of ice against whatever seabirds and fish threatened the territory. Of course, supposedly there were enemy fleets out here somewhere, but somewhere was quite a large area at the bottom of the world.\n\nSuddenly, horns blared, startling the sailors as men rushed to man the light armament of the craft.\n\nThrough the thick haze, Martin could just make out a couple of lights bobbing towards them on the starboard side. They approached the torches cautiously, ready for an engagement. Instead, they found a handful of fishing boats, last at sea after a storm threw them out of known waters. The captain of the lead ship, the Falke, gave them a stern talking to, which seemed all together unnecessary as they made no indication of understanding what he said, and sent them on their way with coordinates.

 antarctica_aag_survival.110.desc:0 "Doktor Thomas Sauer's new office was spartan, but serviceable. During the habitat consolidation after the assault, the infirmary had been moved to a warehouse at the center of the base. It was a bit chilly, but had all the necessary lifesaving tools, and only a two minute walk from all the remaining habitats; a godsend for the months ahead.\n\nJust then, Quartermaster Baumann entered. The once-portly man had been reduced somewhat since the rations started, but he still towered over everyone on base. "We need to talk, Doktor," Baumann said, closing the door. "In a few hours, Mayr's going to announce that we're going to fifty-percent rations.\n\nSauer's nostrils flared as he threw his clipboard on the desk. "Terrific."\n\nBaumann ignored Sauer's anger. "I need to know right now what we can't afford to skimp on in the men's nutritional plan."\n\nSauer scratched his beard. He hadn't had time to shave lately. "They need to keep consuming antiscorbutics: the lemon juice, vegetables, etcetera. The men are already experiencing complications that wouldn't otherwise arise with a full diet." Sauer had also noticed stranger symptoms among the men, but those he kept to himself. Something to alert Mayr to later.\n\n"So we'll have to cut meat by more than half? The men won't be pleased."\n\n"They'll be grateful in a few months when they don't have scurvy. Get Mayr to tell them that."\n\nBaumann massaged his temples. "Well, at least we've still got the emergency supplies.""

 antarctica_aag_survival.111.desc:0 "Quartermaster Baumann felt giddy. He was one of the few men at Schirmacher Station that had clearance to enter the food storage. He could almost pretend he was a secret agent with access to classified documents, except of course in this case, the documents were beans and wurst. His elation was tempered by the weight of the responsibility on his immense shoulders. Baumann felt as if his entire career, nay his life, had led to this moment. He was responsible for the souls and stomachs of Schirmacher!\n\nAs he conducted inventory of the food in the dead of night, his concentration was broken by the door being forced open. A lock clattered to the floor. Baumann knew trouble when he heard it, and ducked behind a stack of crates. Hushed voices carried through the cold, still air. "Quiet, quiet!" said one. "The salt pork is this way. Sauerkraut's to the left." Baumann's blood burned. Thieves, in his storehouse! He would've taken them on but he could hear at least four sets of boots. If they were armed, he wouldn't stand a chance.\n\n"No, no, what are you doing?!" hissed a second voice. "Put that down, we didn't come here to steal cigarettes! If we take too much, they'll know-"\n\n"Shut up," said a third voice. "Mayr's delusional if he thinks we're going to make it through this alive. Might as well enjoy the time we have left." Baumann seethed. Mayr was trying to save them all, and this is how the men repaid him? Outrageous!\n\nAs the pilferers exited the storage, Baumann chanced a glimpse of them. He recognized Weber, a soldier he himself had chosen for guarding the stores. He couldn't make out the other three, but they wore officers' uniforms, a fact which hit Baumann like an Opel Blitz. These supposed "leaders" had literally taken food out of the mouths of their men. This was a sin beyond sins, and Mayr would hear of it. What he would do about it, however, Baumann was unsure..."

The only thing that broke the illusion was the skeletal silhouettes of the assembled men of Schirmacher. Well, that and the gallows.\n\nMayr had heard Baumann's testimony and he'd quickly identified the offending officers. A quick search of their footlockers confirmed their guilt; salt pork, wurst, sauerkraut, cigarettes... Mayr was disgusted. He'd known what course of action to take instantly. He'd had nightmares of this scenario, but it was shocking to see it with his waking eyes. Greed, treachery, betrayal; not of him, but the men. He'd had his engineers raise three construction beams into a pyramid, with a rope hung from the vertex. It would only hang one man at a time, and the dying would be slow via strangulation. He'd asked for men to volunteer for the burden of executing their fellow volk. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the quickest to do so were the very soldiers whom the traitors commanded.\n\nThe first man to be hanged was the one who'd let the officers into the storehouse. "Soldat Arnulf Weber," said Mayr, "you are charged with theft, aiding and abetting theft, and treason against your fellow men. You will be hanged by the neck until dead. You will not be granted last words." Mayr looked to the hangmen, and with a nod, sealed Weber's fate.\n\nIt took twenty minutes for Weber to die. One by one, the traitors were hoisted aloft in full view of all of Mayr's troops. The men watched in a combination of shock and anger, both at the thieving traitors and their desperate situation."

Any satisfaction to be had nowadays was grim in nature.\n\nMayr had been lenient to the thieves, but only in a relative sense. He wanted to hang the bastards but he couldn't throw away four able bodies. The punishment he had decided on, however, most certainly fit the crime: permanent hard labor on quarter rations. Mayr wanted to give these men a taste of the hell they'd have put their comrades through had their theft continued unreported, or repeated.\n\nBaumann strolled by the three officers and the Soldat he'd once trusted. They'd been stripped of rank and uniform, and their legs were bound by a long chain. Mayr hadn't even spared a guard for them, and he figured that after a few days of grueling, cold work, they'd be too weary to attempt to escape. Baumann gathered that Mayr was correct, the men had a gaunt look to them, their clothes draped loose over wilting frames. The work on this day gave Baumann that particularly deep sense of grim satisfaction: the prisoners were digging latrines and shoveling frozen excrement into wheelbarrows to be disposed of.\n\n"Would you look at that," Baumann said to himself. "Never seen shit shoveling shit before." He sadly chuckled as he continued on his way. He had a hot meal and a dram of whiskey waiting for him in his quarters; the same would never again be said for the thieves."

It was common in the Reich for learned men to be ignored by party bureaucrats and ideologues; then again, Mayr was neither.\n\n"How is your new infirmary working for you, Doktor?" asked Mayr as he sat down across from Sauer.\n\nSauer smiled. "It's better than we could expect, given the circumstances. Thank you, sir."\n\n"I'll spare no expense on keeping you and your colleagues supplied. But I've come to you with a very strange issue. The department heads are reporting a great deal of lethargy and despair amongst the men. At first we thought it was just them realizing the severity of the situation, but the erratic behavior from some of our staunchest men troubles me."\n\nSauer sighed. "Have they been taking their antiscorbutics?"\n\nMayr nodded.\n\n"I've noticed redness of the gums in many of my patients and even some cases of joint pain. It's my medical opinion that we're witnessing the onset of scurvy."\n\nMayr looked like the wind had been knocked out of him. "How is that possible?! We've been drinking lemon juice daily."\n\n"Over time, lemon juice loses its potency. It's also possible the Reich sent us old juice from one of the other Reichskommissariats. I recommend sending out more hunting parties immediately. The Englishman, Robert Scott's 1901 Antarctic expedition discovered that fresh meat alleviates scurvy.""

 antarctica_aag_survival.115.desc:0 "Doktor Sauer's infirmary was full to bursting. The vitamin C deficiency had gone on for months and scurvy had set in in earnest. Many men were too weak to stand, let alone work. The crews who cleared snow away from the domiciles and repaired the base now had half their personnel bedridden. Sauer had many advanced treatments and medicines, but all they could do was alleviate the men's pain. Without vitamin C, the inhabitants of Schirmacher Station were literally disintegrating.\n\nVitamin C was a fundamental of the body's chemistry. It was used to maintain the structural integrity of cells. Without it, the body simply collapsed; bruises never fade, ulcers erupted in every organ, and food that once tasted sweet now felt like acid on the tongue.\n\nWithin the last hour alone, Sauer had witnessed all of these symptoms and a host of more worrying ones. He'd most recently examined a veteran of the Eastern Front who, during his service, had been pockmarked with fleshwounds. As a result of the scurvy afflicting him, the cellulose in his scar tissue had rotted away and the decades-old injuries reopened. It was as if the ghosts of the Soviets were reaching from their graves to claim the enemy who'd escaped them.\n\nSauer himself had had trouble concentrating recently, and noticed his gums oozed blood. There was no recourse for anyone at Schirmacher, save what little meat the hunting parties had brought in. Sauer had also noticed in recent days some symptoms in the men which he could not place: extremely high blood pressure and skull splitting headaches. These symptoms manifested in people who did not have any signs of scurvy. For the first time, Sauer wondered if there was more than one microscopic terror ravaging Neuschwabenland."

"You'd better have some answers for me, Doktor. Ten good, loyal men died yesterday in your infirmary, all less than eight hours apart from each other."\n\nSauer gingerly placed the bag with the tin inside on Mayr's desk. "There. That's our culprit."\n\nMayr looked at the bag, then at Baumann, then at Sauer. "Elaborate."\n\n"It seems the ineffective antiscorbutics are the least of our worries," Sauer said. "The men who died experienced vomiting, diarrhea, muscle spasms, and extreme seizures in our last hours. These are not symptoms of scurvy, so I immediately conducted a toxicological test on the dead men." He took a breath before saying, "It's botulism, sir. Baumann and I carefully examined our remaining tinned foods. It seems at least a third, if not more, were improperly sealed, leading to invasion by Clostridia Botulinum bacteria.\n\nMayr collapsed into his chair, speechless.\n\n"Unfortunately," Sauer continued slowly, "it gets worse. When I tested the tins themselves, I discovered that lead had leached into the food. I then ran blood tests on the men, and myself. We've all got lead poisoning. It's been accumulating for years. It seems to have originated from the poor quality solder used to seal the canned food, improperly I might add."\n\nBaumann concluded by saying what all three men were thinking.

Grasser stood and spoke immediately after the formalities were done with. "Keeping the supply chains running is complex and straining at the best of times, and now it might be a death sentence."\n\n"Very well, Herr Grasser, but then why call us all here?" Herrmann inquired, "It seems a simple thing to inform us of during tomorrow's meeting."\n\n"Yes, well, there is an important decision to be made concerning how we go about recalling our forces. Either we rush the order, expediting the return as much as possible. This would save us the supplies we would otherwise continue to waste on them as they prepared to return. The other option is to layer the return, ensuring security of the territory as forces slowly pull back."\n\nHerrmann spoke up first. "If we are to survive this crisis, we need to conserve as many supplies as possible. I say we order a quick return."\n\nMayr turned from the academic to the securityman.

The plane's lifeblood spent in an effort to stay alive. Other vehicles suffered the same fate. Snowcat drivers sat in their vehicles and pulled the fuel tab for the last time. Not even the lone patrol boat that chose to stay with Neuschwabenland was spared.\n\nThe high command prefaced this as a precautionary measure. Everyone knew otherwise.

They'd been close friends since they'd arrived in Neuschwabenland, and together had spent one rotation after another in the outlying outposts that dotted the Antarctic landscape. They'd been recalled to Schirmacher in the wake of the SS assault. The situation had not improved since then: ration cuts and deprivation of the few things that made life bearable here, namely cigarettes, had convinced the trio that it was time to leave. Impassioned speeches did little to soothe their depression. The three men had stored the bulk of their food rations in a crate buried in the snow inside the husk of a burned habitat. They'd also secured a can of petrol thanks to Schneider's posting in the fuel depot.\n\n"Hurry, hurry!" Hartmann whispered.\n\n"I'm going as fast as I can!" Krüger hissed.\n\n"One minute, forty-five seconds until next rotation," said Schneider, looking at his watch.\n\nThe lock clicked. "Got it!" said Krüger, opening the door. The three men piled in, supplies in tow, and started the engine. The vehicle, long dormant, roared to life, and the men made a desperate drive for the perimeter. Shouts and alarms followed them into the Antarctic night. Krüger shut off the lights; he knew the route out of the Schirmacher Oasis, but as to their destination, where would they go?"

Now, however, with clear skies, Kruger wasn't certain he'd been right.\n\n"Are you sure you're still going the right way?" Schneider asked. He nodded out the left window at a distant mountain range. "Those peaks weren't there before the blizzard."\n\n"No," Kruger admitted, "I'm not sure. We were driving for six hours through that blizzard. We still kept the correct bearing so we should be roughly on course."\n\nHartmann pulled out his compass. "I'm not so sure about that, Kruger. This thing is acting funny."\n\nSighing, Kruger swung the wheel to the right, making for an open plain nearer to the coast. "I suppose if we hug the shoreline, we'll get to the Argentine dock. It'll be a few days later and hungrier than planned but-"\n\n"Shh!" Schneider hissed. "Did you hear that? Stop the tractor."\n\nKruger did so. He listened carefully. He heard nothing but the low rumble of the engine, which he didn't shut off because there was no guarantee it would restart. "We're wasting fuel," he said, putting the tractor in gear. "If we don't-"\n\nHe got no further than that. The ice plain was in fact a shelf that in the process of calving; the weight of the tractor caused a yawning chasm to form.

Kruger and Schneider knew better: Hartmann had always been the first to share his booze and cigarettes, and the last to take what was offered to him. His was a generous soul, and in a final, futile gesture, he'd taken himself out of the equation. Two men could survive longer than three.\n\nHowever, that was with the assumption rescue was coming. Kruger knew none was coming. Schirmacher Station would not spare resources for traitors. Now too weak to move, Kruger and Schneider sat in the cabin and watched the snow drift by. As they watched, black, waddling forms drifted across their vision. Armies of penguins marched in disciplined columns across the ice, moving toward the coast to find fish for their young.\n\n"This is their country," Kruger joked.

The SS at the gate didn't open fire; on the contrary, the gates swung open and Krüger, Schneider, and Hartmann were allowed inside... but only after hoods had been drawn over their heads.\n\nAs they were guided through the twisting labyrinth of the Antarktis Gruppe outpost, they heard all manner of strange noises: screams, mechanical buzzing, and chanting in the dark. Krüger wondered if they'd made the right decision. His contemplation was broken by blinding light as the hoods were lifted off the trio. In front of them was the terrifying visage of Wolfram Sievers. The man had soulless eyes and a slight downturn to his mouth. Beside him stood a man in a labcoat carrying a clipboard and calipers.\n\nSievers finally spoke. "Things must be bad at Schirmacher."

You got any?"\n\nMartin took a deep breath... he had one. "You guys don't mind a joke about Hitler, right?"\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n"Well, I heard this joke across the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and it goes like this.

Come to think of it... how exactly did someone get a bruise in the crook of their elbow.\n\nHannemann's introspection was suddenly broken by a pile of slop landing on his lunch tray. It looked colder and smaller than usual. He looked up at the cook, who simply shrugged and said, "Mayr's orders."\n\nHannemann noticed that as the men received their food, one by one, the agitation in the room increased until it was palpable to all within and without. By now they all had realized, like Hannemann had, that their rations had once again been cut. By Hannemann's reckoning, it was by another quarter at least. Some men had taken to arguing with the cooks, who stepped back from the counter, pleading their innocence. Just as the situation was about to become violent, Mayr, Grasser, and a squad of armed loyalist soldiers stepped through the door.\n\n"Everyone on your knees right now!" Mayr roared, holding a pistol in his hand. Most immediately dropped their trays and subordinated themselves. Others did so slowly and begrudgingly. All obeyed in the end. "This measure is for our survival," said Mayr, walking the room. "We have no other choice. None of us knew the going would be this hard, but we knew we would face it together.

Hell, whole groups of men tried to abscond with either themselves, supplies, or both. Damn fools. Only death awaited those who tried to run from Schirmacher.\n\nPaul, one of Grasser's chosen soldats, burst in. "Sir, we have a serious problem! A group of the men we investigated for sedition have convinced others to join them and they've seized one of the supply depots!"\n\nGrasser jumped out of his chair. "What about the guards protecting the food?"\n\n"They've been taken hostage sir. Like I said, it's serious."\n\nGrasser grabbed his greatcoat and stormed out of his office. He waded into a sea of chaos outside the food depot. A crowd was assembled, either hurling insults at the traitors or begging for a tin of sauerkraut. Grasser had nearly thirty men left at his disposal, and used them to disperse the exterior crowd, leaving him to deal with the crisis on the inside of the supply dump. If he attacked the depot, supplies and men might be lost, not to mention the danger to the hostages. If he chose to negotiate, who knows what kind of precedent that might set..."

"If I recall correctly, there might be some tear gas left over in the armory from the old colonial police force. They never got a chance to use it since the colony failed."\n\n"Good," said Grasser.

"Tell me," he said to the rebels, "is anyone hurt? I don't want further bloodshed. We're all comrades, here. You men made a hasty decision, but it doesn't have to cost you your lives..." As he spoke, Paul and his team arrived with grenade launchers armed with gas grenades. At a gesture from Grasser, the sound of shattered tempered glass echoed through the lanes of Schirmacher and a hissing drone filled the air as the canisters released their contents.\n\n"Go!" said Grasser. Paul led the men forward wearing gas masks. They slammed the front door with an impromptu battering ram, simultaneous with an assault on the rear exit.

In the aftermath, the leadership of Schirmacher Station had become inundated with other requests for more rations with numerous exculpatory rationales. In short, Grasser had gotten his police back in one piece, but now there were many more men who needed policing.\n\n"I recommend adding these three to our watchlist," said Paul, placing a dossier on Grasser's desk. "I suggest we bring the first one in for immediate enhanced questioning..."\n\nIn the past few hours, at least a hundred names had been added to a list of malcontents whom Grasser's guard had orders to surveill. This task was becoming harder and harder as all men, even those under Grasser's command, began to succumb to cold, hunger, and disease. To keep up with the deteriorating security situation, Grasser had managed to convince Mayr to allocate his men some additional food, which further inflamed tensions between the rabble and the police.

Most men were the same: they ate without hesitation. Some were more hesitant, but they ate in the end all the same.\n\nMayr had forced no one to eat human flesh; this was purely voluntary. A good half the base had come for the first plating. The rest, Ryker was sure, would follow very soon; the moment they saw their comrades regain their vitality, they wouldn't be able to resist. Besides, most could rationalize this gruesome feast because they were devouring the flesh of the traitorous SS, not that of comrades.\n\nRyker had heard in an intelligence briefing that certain New Zealanders used to eat the flesh of their dead foes as an expression of conquest.

But all complaints had long since ceased, and the return of the hunting parties with game was a celebrated event.\n\nHowever, the parties had to travel farther and farther from Schirmacher Station to find viable hunting grounds.

He'd seen how quickly an army could disintegrate into chaos once order had broken down. He'd seen it during the West Russian War as columns of a Soviet enemy, long since thought defeated, rolled over fresh conscripts. The troops became looters overnight, their officers nothing more than an obstacle to their next meal. The men simply stopped being soldiers.

Grasser had outlined a plan to disarm almost all the men on base and select a dedicated force of trustworthy soldiers to protect the food supply. These men would bear arms, guard the dwindling stores, and assist in policing the station. To that end, they had to be in good spirits, fit, and well-known by the officers. Mayr had explicitly ordered that only a quarter of the men could be those that participated in Schumann's coup. He was still wary of another attempt to seize power. Grasser respected that.\n\nGrasser had rounded up nearly a hundred men of all distinctions: scientists, soldiers, it mattered little what their previous occupation was. What mattered was that they could satisfy Mayr and Grasser's criteria. Grasser had cordoned off an empty hangar and turned it into a training ground for the potential security force. Men crawled under banks of barbed wire, hoisted themselves up ropes, at least a quarter of the men were in a back corner of the room, doing pushups. Grasser watched these men intently.\n\n"Come on, come on!" Grasser barked. "Push yourselves! I've seen emaciated Slavs that were more active than you bastards!"\n\nOne by one, men dropped out, too exhausted to continue. By the end of the day, a cadre of fifty remained. Equipped with properly fitted uniforms, shined boots, and polished rifles they cut a fearsome visage, Grasser was keenly aware they would no doubt see use, and soon..."

Some of my friends in the labs have crunched the numbers, and there's no way they can keep all of us alive, not even most of us. Mayr and the others are lying to us, and no amount of wishful thinking or camaraderie will save us."\n\nAs Franz slammed his fist into the table, he took another swig from a bottle of liquor he'd found in one of his boat excavations. He had spent two winters prowling the ice for wrecked ships and he knew that none had borne any significant amount of supplies. There was no secret stash, no hope.\n\nAs the men sitting across from Franz nodded, the doors to the rec room flew open. All the men froze.\n\nGrasser's elite guards, the only remaining armed men in Schirmacher, marched in. They seized Franz and dragged him from the room, delivering blows from their truncheons to any who were too slow to get out of the way. A soldat named Paul dragged Franz to Grasser's improvised interrogation chamber. Grasser had built it in his office, sound proofing added so as to not disturb the men.\n\nThe man himself waited within. He didn't entrust this part to any other. His men had heard rumors of sedition and that this Franz was keeping an illicit store of booze for himself and any who'd listen to his traitorous lies. Unaccounted-for liquor was dangerous: it was a great tool for enticing people to listen to you and for removing their inhibitions about doing something stupid. Schirmacher Station could ill afford another revolt, from any quarter.\n\nEither way Franz had lied to his superior and intentionally engendered paranoia. As such his life was forfeit and in Grasser's estimation a little enhanced interrogation was letting Franz off light."

Day and night, it's always the same.\n\nUntil today, that is. Our scouting team came across a trail of metal parts in the ice, leading to what was clearly an older aircraft. We quickly brushed the snow off the machine to investigate further. The captain of our scouting team recognized the plane as a Ki-37, a Japanese transport plane from der Krieg. It was in an inoperable state, as both engines were missing parts, and the propellers were bent. The landing appeared to be a move of desperation.

The second had a single gunshot wound to the back of the head alongside a broken leg. The final corpse had no visible injuries besides bleeding around the mouth. No journals or personal items were left behind, besides a small ledger listing supplies on the plane. All food listed was absent.\n\nAfter a thorough search of the room, we found nothing else. We took the small cache of guns and left. But the perfectly intact scene won't leave my head. #2 had a broken leg, likely from the plane's harsh landing; Was he shot as a mercy kill? Or was it to lower the number of mouths to feed? Either way, he was the weak link due to his injury. He must have been the first to die. #1's position also bothers me. Was he trying to prevent #3 from firing the rifle? Was he killed later on as food thinned out? #3 must have consumed cyanide or suffered an internal injury.\n\nWe walk a thin line between civility and barbarism.

Those that broke would be on the first ship back to Germania next spring, and some always broke.\n\nHoundmaster Theodore Baden wasn't one of them, however. A veteran of many Antarctic winters, three of them consecutive; an unheard-of feat for any German. Trips back home or elsewhere were considered necessary to reinvigorate the men, but the only reinvigoration Baden needed was the company of his Siberian huskies.\n\nIt was a paradox, thought Baden, that for all their hatred of the Eastern Menace, the German Reich still understood that Siberia had something useful to offer: the humble sled dog. Dozens had been bought for use in Neuschwabenland's breeding program, leading to hundreds of high quality specimens.\n\nBaden gazed lovingly at his dogs. They slept like wolves, making sure each one touched another in the pack with a paw, snout, or tail. Sled teams were the legs of any Antarctic operation. They were fast, light, and could carry a great deal. After fuel lines had frozen and treads became jammed with ice, the husky remained the last, best means of running supplies to the distant outposts of Neuschwabenland.

He and his hounds shared an almost-telepathic bond.\n\nHe'd departed Schirmacher Station at first light, the first full sunrise in nearly four months. He'd seen ranks of dejected Wehrmacht personnel shuffling towards the first relief ships, eager to return home and feel warm again. Some had gone mad over the long winter months, the isolation consuming them totally. The Reich claimed to have put everyone in Neuschwabenland through intense isolation training to gauge their mental fortitude. Baden knew this was a load of dogshit. This place was a home for exiles and failures, problems the Reich wanted to sweep under the rug.\n\nBaden was bound for the lonely outpost of Arminius Station, a scientific facility mainly concerned with the enormous penguin legions that roamed the nearby Antarctic shelf. As he navigated another narrow canyon, he emerged to see Arminius Station. It looked like it was barely holding onto the ice. The swastika flag had frozen completely to the post.

Mayr had sagely chosen to save the dogs; a clear indication of his Antarctic experience. The sled teams had proven their worth within the week, running out to border outposts to save men and material stranded by inclement weather and the SS. Baden himself led most of the sojourns to rescue these men and bring them back to Schirmacher Station.\n\nOn their most recent trip, Baden had come across a half-buried building from the colonial era.

By comparing quartermaster's reports on this colony here," pointing to the map, "with the shipping manifests of the vessels aiding the exodus, there emerges some discrepancies we can't afford not to investigate."\n\nKrause chimed in.

There were so few left now: the command staff and a handful of soldiers who hadn't yet succumbed to starvation, disease, or the elements. The food had run out and the fuel for the base's generators ran dry. It was dark, and the cold was creeping in, some men had given into their darker impulses and feasted on the flesh of the dead, it gave them no relief. Krause, Becker, and Hans Beimler had volunteered to take the remaining MBB Bo 115 with whatever scraps of fuel they could find to try and reach the Argentinians, but they all knew that such an act was futile, and far too late. The last anyone saw of the trio was yesterday morning as they took off into a twilight sky.\n\nOrder had broken down completely, but truth be told, there wasn't much rebelliousness left in anyone. Each man simply sought to die in the way they saw fit: some had taken pistols to their heads, others tucked into the remaining alcohol supplies, and yet others took a walk into the Great White Nothing, never to be seen again. Mayr saw the appeal of all three options, but some residual pride in the back of his brain kept him at his post. It wasn't out of loyalty to the Reich or the tenets of National Socialism. It was just that Rudolf Mayr was a stubborn bastard, and he wished to spend his last moments with his friends."

He threw his Luger onto the table. "Paul asked for my help," he said with a clenched jaw. "He'd always planned to go out fighting, and in a way he did. I don't think any other man on Earth could have fought scurvy as hard as he did."\n\nThe other men nodded slowly. Mayr logged the final names on the list of the fallen: Doktor Thomas Sauer, Quartermaster Elias Baumann, Obersoldat Paul Langemann. He had kept a log of every fallen soldier, and secured it in his desk in a steel box, along with the last will and testaments of the officers. Then, he noticed a quizzical look on Schumann's face. "What are you smirking at?" Mayr asked.\n\n"Oh," said Schumann, "I was just thinking... Hitler declared a thousand year Reich, yet he never stood a chance of seeing it last. But down here, in the cold and the dark... our bodies won't decay. Our facilities might collapse but everything we built won't be weathered, it'll last for eons, trapped in snow and ice. The continent drifts at a rate of a few millimeters to a centimeter per year, which means Schirmacher will remain here forever." He stood up and saluted Mayr.

"We did the best we could with the resources we had," said Hermann. "Right?"\n\n"Yes," said Schirmacher forcefully, as if trying to reassure himself more than Hermann. "We did. We went above and beyond our duty with much less than we needed to survive. Our men, for the most part, conducted themselves with honor and integrity to their last moments. No one could ask for more, and if they did, I'd tell them to go fuck themselves."\n\n"I think you cursed us, Richard," Mayr said, smiling. "You, in your hubris, named this whole damn continent after yourself, now we're paying for it."\n\nSchirmacher knocked back the last of his drink and laughed. "I'm just glad to have played my role in history."\n\nErnst slapped him on the back. "Here here."\n\nHad anyone walked into the room at that moment, they might not have guessed anything was wrong.

It was as if the nightmare had never happened. Dreams of aeronautical miracles and nuclear experimentation froze solid in the face of Antarctica's retaliation. Schirmacher had become a city of the dead, forever to stand watch over this little slice of the Reich.\n\nSuddenly, something stirred; something that lived. A lone shape trudged through the deep snow, totally insensitive to the wind and the destruction around it. This form was joined by another... and then another... and then another, until an army swept into the ruins of the base. Humans were not meant for this continent, but that didn't mean life had no place here. Schirmacher Station was turned, in the course of a single afternoon, into a rookery for a million nesting penguins.\n\nIt seemed the hunting parties had never even come close to discovering the true numbers of their penguin prey, and now an avian legion laid its eggs where the Aryan Race had once laid its head.\n\nA single, magnificent emperor penguin waddled through the corridors. It found shelter against the wind, which was more than it could ever have hoped for.

The Exile woke slowly, mirroring the sun's light in its relaxed shaking off of the night. It turned its ancient, weary gaze towards its coastal companion's newfound metallic grave, another mark made on the ocean-facing plateau.\n\nDays before, the last survivors of the desolation that had been wrought on the tiny sanctuary of life and heat had died with a whisper, and with that one of the few foreign bases on the Exile had been completely snuffed out.\n\nWhether they died of hunger, disease, or simple exhaustion the Exile could not tell, but it had seen the events that led up to this conclusion time and again in the past. Strangers would come from across the ocean, confident in their strength, wielding flame and light to burn back the ice and cast out the dark.\n\nInevitably, the uncaring void which they entered willingly, in the end, always consumed them. They were woefully unprepared, and would all in time, succumb. What had made the Exile curious about the recent arrivals to its coastline was that they seemed far more numerous, prepared, and organized. The Exile even recognized some of their ranks as previous visitors.\n\nIt did not matter, in the end the interlopers had capitulated to nature's wrath.\n\nAnd so the Exile shifted its gaze towards more eventful plateaus, settling in to watch yet more of its' companions hold out, or suffer the same fate as Neuschwabenland, at the cold unforgiving edge of the world."

 antarctica_aag_rescue.1.desc:0 "The ship crested a wave as it emerged from the storms that had harried it as it sailed down the Atlantic. The captain complained incessantly, but the mission's leader, Rolf, had been relieved when he heard that the journey would have to be taken as a storm swept off the Arctic. It meant less time for the OFN or Brazil to confront the German expedition, which they surely would want to after the loss of the liberal Speerite cause in the Reich.\n\nA few days after leaving the storms behind, the ship docked at Schirmacher Station to find a greeting party made up of some officers with the base's namesake at their head. Mayr was still recovering from an illness and couldn't come to meet the men from Germania. Rolf was assured that Mayr meant no insult and was a Bormannite through and through, to which the officer responded by assuring the base's leaders that he was simply here to ensure the new administration takes over smoothly.\n\nHowever, other elements in the base were less loyal than Mayr, and they mourned for their lost dreams. Schumann sat quietly in his office, ensuring all his ties to Göring and the militarists were ash in the fireplace. He also began carving out a new place for himself in the new order, asking after the few contacts he had held onto in the conservative camp.\n\nSimilarly, Herrmann also sat in his office, coming to terms with the world he would be returning to in Germany. When he had left for the most southern of continents, he had hoped that whenever, if ever he returned to his homeland, that it would have escaped the specter of the '30s and '40s, but it seemed that dream had been shattered by the incomprehensible party machinations.\n\nFinally, Grasser mourned the loss of his sons. Along with the men from Germania had come a letter from his wife, informing him of the deaths of both his children. One had fought and died in the streets of Frankfurt, fighting for a better future, while the other had lost his life in the hills of Prussia, defending against the final push of the Bormannites, fighting for the glory of his nation. Now, the future seemed gloomy for the aging officer, and he prepared his letters of resignation and to settle into a quiet life in the hills of Bavaria."

Alas, it seemed that this was as real as anything in recent times, and did it really come as a surprise that the end of this surreal time would be heralded by such an unexpected message?\n\nThe German Civil War had been won by the reformist faction, led by Albert Speer, and the victors had begun their reforms the moment they won. The message came from the Auswärtiges Amt, from the desk of one "Helmut Schmidt," a name none of the high command at Schirmacher Station seemed to know.\n\nThe memo's contents were short and to the point. It implored the Antarctic exiles to make immediate contact with Germania and informed them that a rescue mission was on the way, though it had to navigate the now-hostile Atlantic without the support of the German navy, which was still holed up with Dönitz in the Black Sea.\n\nAs Mayr mused on the possibilities of his and his men's future under Speer's Reich, the base erupted in celebration. For all their hardships and losses, they were being saved. What few luxuries remained were passed around and the base, even in its state of disrepair, was filled with the uplifting feeling of hope.\n\nIn his own office, Ernst Herrmann wept. He wept for the suffering of the exiles, finally being relieved, but only after immense pain and torment. He wept for his family, who he hoped were alive and well back in Germany. He wept, for the future of Europe now had a chance, however slim, of turning away from the atrocities of Nazism and the shackles of slavery and towards the faint rays of freedom that had once existed during the heyday of the Weimar Republic."

They explained Mayr's inability to attend due to illness, and as they spoke supplies were unloaded and dragged to the center of the base.\n\nAs the supplies were distributed amongst the remnants of Neuschwabenland, Mayr, Schirmacher, Schumann, Grasser, and the officer leading the rescue mission gathered in Mayr's office. They went over the logistical plans for the immediate future and discussed the state of the Reich. Finally, in a move Mayr had known was coming since Göring's victory had been announced, he and the high command of the territory were honorably discharged from service, to return to Europe with most of their men. Mercifully, they would all be given a full retirement, and Mayr and Schirmacher would receive  permanent advisory positions in the German Society for Polar Research.\n\nMeanwhile, Schumann was given temporary control of the territory, and was promised a position when the new administration arrived for his admirable loyalty to the new Führer.

There was a sense of dread looking at the Antarctic shoreline. Everything around was white, to the point that it hurt to look at the ground for too long.\n\nThere were depressions, marks and tracks yet the snow always swallowed those up. It was as if Nature herself was applying her makeup, scrubbing out any imperfections or blemishes. Humanity wasn't supposed to live here - at least not for an extended period.

A combination like fire and gasoline, Abetz mused. There was little information about his activities in the fifties, but considering the number of Deutsche Bank files and notes on the man, it seemed that he was a very small fish in a very large lake.\n\nLastly, Erich Ehrlinger. SiPo, SS, SD, RSHA. So was Hettlage, but from the report Ehrlinger was a true believer. 'Anti-Partisan Actions' in the Baltics. The leader of a 70-80 unit strong unit near Leningrad, he bragged that he personally 'put down over 4,000 Semite partisans' over the course of the war.

The SS had launched an attack on Schirmacher Station and Kinzel swore he'd repay the act in kind."

 antarctica_aag_rescue.70.desc:0 "Mayr felt the Iron Cross in his hand, letting his fingers run over edges and the smooth silver. Closing his eyes, he found himself in his Focke Wulf. The clouds slipped past him, painted in amber by the dying light over the English Channel. The sun seemed larger when he was above the clouds;  the one burning constant when he flew in combat missions. It was so simple. Inside the cockpit, he had one mission. Shoot down the enemy and make sure that you weren't shot down yourself. Mayr chuckled. That's what they were, weren't they? Just the enemy, some faceless figure or shadow inside a falling, burning wreck that would earn him a medal or two. Just another notch to paint. Just another casualty. Perhaps with the age of time, his golden years became better at hiding the fact that they were fool's gold.\n\n"Excuse me, are you Rudolf Mayr?" a tall, sharp-looking man stood in the doorway. Mayr shook himself from his daze, facing the man. Maude Suit - probably bought at some gaudy shop in Neukölln. A tie that looked too tight. A stack of documents and files held underneath his shoulder. The man looked more likely to sell him a Yellow-Back than run a top-secret installation in the most desolate patch of land on Planet Earth. "My name is Konstanty. Konstanty Gutschow. I'm here to take over the research base? Are you Herr Mayr?"\n\nRising to his feet, Mayr eyed his replacement. Konstanty Gutschow, in the flesh. Speer could have sent a world-weary bureaucrat or a battle-scarred general - instead he sent an architect. "I expected as much. It's not like we get Generalfeldmarschall Rommel strolling around here. I assume you are my successor, then."\n\n"I am indeed, sir. The Führer has decided to change tactics here. Bring in some new blood, wipe the dust off some old fantasies that the most bright and least sane in the Reich had." Gutschow shook hands. This was Rudolf Mayr? The famous flying ace himself - a prisoner of his own volition. He didn't even shave himself for the occasion. "If you wouldn't mind, could you show me around? Considering I have the next few years of staring at Ice to look forward to, it's a nice change of pace."\n\nMayr nodded, and brushed past Gutschow. The clipped pigeon couldn't comprehend it, but he had plans. Plans that would transform Antarctica from a peripheral wasteland to the chess piece that they needed to win the war."

 antarctica_aag_rescue.71.desc:0 ""Herr Mayr. " Viktor Lutze gave a short Hitler salute, before clacking his ice-clogged boots together. "My name is Viktor Lutze, and I am to be your successor. It is my pleasure to meet you," he said. Mayr nodded, giving a half-hearted salute. This was the end of the road for him. After so much time had been spent in the frozen wastelands, this was the man he'd pass the baton to.\n\n"Herr Lutze, my only pleasure now is to go home. I do not know what you did in Europe to deserve such a cruel and unusual punishment, but I can only say one thing to you. My condolences." Mayr stumbled past Lutze, scratching at his stubble while trying to pack his misplaced bits and bobs. The Reich was sending more men to Antarctica, moreover, Bormann was sending his partymen to freeze in this frozen prison. Perhaps, Mayr thought, Europe was not the ideal destination to have his reunion. The last thing he needed was to be shepherded from the frying pan and into the oven, by bayonet point. Still... better than Africa.\n\n"I was not 'punished', Herr Mayr." Lutze took out a cigar and lit it with a small, ornamental lighter. Mayr wondered if it had been looted from a dead Jew's hands or merely stolen from their burning home. "I volunteered. You see, I think that Germany needs to keep a better eye out on Antarctica; see I think that we have been ignoring this place's potential for far, far too long. You understand me, Herr Mayr?"\n\n"There is nothing out here to ignore. Unless you count the penguins." Mayr shoved his stained, creased clothes into his suitcases. He didn't even use half of them, but they had become dirty regardless. Odd. "You want to start a war with Tokyo or Washington, that's fine by me, Lutze. Just make sure that my boat leaves harbor, before you send you to start digging snow trenches."\n\n"I do not intend to start anything, Herr Mayr," Lutze said, his tone considerably more agitated. "I intend to do my duty to the Reich. I intend to do my duty to the entire Aryan Race, by guarding the one area not touched by mankind. But it will be. It will be embraced by the brightest and best of the German Reich, and we will prevail on every single continent on the planet!"\n\nMayr turned around. Fool thought he was worth something down here. God, he envied him. Mayr walked past Lutze, opened the door and walked out into the bright, Antarctic morning."

 antarctica_aag_rescue.80.desc:0 "Erich Schumann stood alone. His loyal man, Grasser, was at the docks overseeing the unloading of endless military supplies. Goring had achieved a total victory over the other pretenders and now stood as Führer of the Thousand Year Reich. Schumann's role in these events had not played out as planned, but nonetheless, here Schumann stood, alone.\n\nIn front of him was the chair where Mayr once sat, the desk he once wrote upon, and the office from which he'd commanded Neuschwabenland. It was all Schumann's. His mind was awash with visions of a nuclear future, his creation elevated to ever greater technological heights to ensure the preservation of the Aryan race. Even this, he thought, might not be enough, and if there was one thing which Schumann never lacked, it was imagination.\n\nIn the last Krieg, the Reich had been hesitant to deploy chemical and biological weapons. Goring had assured Schumann he did not share this compunction. The most caustic and virulent agents of the Reich stood ready for shipment to Neuschwabenland. Schumann needed only to say the word.\n\nHe slowly circled the desk and sat down in Mayr's chair. It was smaller than he expected. Grasser entered the room.

 antarctica_aag_rescue.90.desc:0 "The blue sky was streaked with red, orange, and yellow clouds, creating a wondrous scene on the horizon. Beneath the heavens, ponderous vessels sailed across the deep oceans that kept the Exile so far from its siblings. They docked on the desolate shores where silence had reigned in recent days, unloading crates thrice the size of the little beings who scrambled over them.\n\nThe Exile had been watching the visitors on that shore closely. It watched as the vessels stopped arriving at their jutting piers. It watched as they flocked towards their largest settlement, hanging like a small but persistent barnacle on the side of the continent. It watched as they descended into madness and despair, seemingly abandoned in an inhospitable land, alone and afraid for their lives. In those moments, the Exile couldn't help but feel some companionship with these tiny beings, clinging on for dear life at the end of the Earth.\n\nThen, an unusual thing happened. As they stood on their last legs, just barely holding out against the elements and internal divisions, a lone vessel appeared on the horizon. It sailed straight for the settlement, and soon the abandoned visitors had noticed it as well. As time wore on, they were renewed by more newcomers. As the ponderous continent settled in for another summer in exile, it could sense a feeling on the breeze on that shore that it hadn't felt for millennia: change. The winds of change blowing over the Antarctic shores..."
