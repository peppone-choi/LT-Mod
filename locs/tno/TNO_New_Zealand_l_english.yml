 ## Leader Bios
 # National Party
 POLITICS_KEITH_HOLYOAKE_DESC:0 "Keith Holyoake is a man known for many things - his level-headedness, thick accent, and reputation for being overly polite amongst them. Holyoake's origins lie in the rural areas of New Zealand, being the son of a pair of store owners turned farmers. Joining the rurally-focused Reform Party in 1932, Holyoake quickly became a rising star in the party, playing a key role in reforming it into the modern National Party.\n\nTaking the role of Prime Minister in the First National Government, Holyoake presided over National's loss in 1957, following the resignation of previous Prime Minister Sidney Holland in 1956. Three years were spent as leader of the opposition, before going on to win the 1960 General Election, earning the position in his own right.\n\nAdvocating for the maintenance of a strong national defense against the ever-present threat of the Japanese, Holyoake's ministry has already begun to pursue a progressive social agenda of abolishing capital punishment and expanding Māori rights. As the 1963 General Election looms closer, Holyoake hopes that New Zealand will continue to endorse his vision."
 POLITICS_ROBERT_MULDOON_DESC:0 "There are two sides to Robert Muldoon. On the outside, there is the roaring defender of the free world, someone not afraid to take on the fascists, elitists, and smart alecs who want to trample on the common man. On the inside lies a more cautious man, a caring soul who doesn't wish to hurt anyone. How he reconciles the two, no one knows.\n\nRaised under rocky circumstances after his father was committed to a mental hospital, he fell under the influence of his grandmother, a passionate socialist. Though he would never admit it, she shaped his beliefs toward a strong welfare state. Serving in WW2, the shock defeat of the Allies pushed him to hawkish positions, becoming a noted advocate of the OFN.\n\nAfter the war, Muldoon joined the National Party, quickly becoming active within it. In 1957, he scored a surprise victory against incumbent Norman King and became an MP. In the Holland and Holyoake administrations, he proved himself a rising star, serving with skill in positions of increasing seniority. After Holyoake's fall, many turned to Muldoon for a change of pace and personality, both of which they got in spades.\n\nAs Prime Minister, he has quickly earned his fair share of admirers and antagonists with an abrasive attitude unwilling to entertain others. As far as Rob's concerned, it's his way or the highway, hand-in-hand with the OFN against fascism. Everyone else can get in line or get out of the way."
 POLITICS_JACK_MARSHALL_DESC:0 "Against the tide of radicalism and populism that has taken over the globe, a quiet gentleman stands guard to guarantee New Zealand against the threat that has afflicted so many other countries during this century. That man's name is Jack Marshall.\n\nBorn in New Zealand but descending from Scotland, Marshall enjoyed a comfortably middle-class upbringing, later studying and entering a career in law. However, liberty called to him, leading to him enlisting as a soldier during WW2. While his time was uneventful, he learned hard lessons from New Zealand's defeat in the war.\n\nLeaving law to enter politics, he found his next calling in the National Party, rising to the rank of Holyoake's deputy. Unfortunately for him, Holyoake came to prefer Muldoon over himself, leading to Rob being tapped as the next leader of National. However, Marshall had the last laugh after Muldoon's critics turned to him, alienated by their former leader's abrasiveness and frustrated by his losing of a winnable election.\n\nNow Prime Minister, like Muldoon, his every move seems to be watched by the government and the opposition. "He is too nice." "He isn't bold enough." "How can he inspire anyone?" As the days go by, Marshall will have to prove his critics wrong, or else end up like Muldoon, the man he dethroned."
 POLITICS_BRIAN_TALBOYS_DESC:0 "New Zealand stands at the edge of a precipice. Behind her, a mass of countries burned alive. In front of her, certain death. As Talboys watches New Zealand, he repeats a mantra to himself over and over again — "There must be another way."\n\nRaised in a traditional Christian household, Brian Talboys enjoyed a proper upbringing, afforded all the middle-class luxuries he could desire in education and other matters. When the war broke out, Talboys enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, staying close but not too close to danger as the old world fell apart for the new order.\n\nAfter the war, he became a farmer, a profession that led him to the National Party. As an MP, he ascended the political ladder with ease thanks to his inability to displease, considered an affable and mild figure. Talboys made connections in all the right places as his National peers continued to be impressed with his work. Most assumed he didn't have the backbone to be a leader, but here he is today.\n\nTruthfully, they may still be correct, a thought even Talboys himself considers. Nevertheless, there is no going back now. The National Party will survive and thrive or falter to Labour's populism. There is no mythical third way to be found, only a choice to do or die."
 POLITICS_KEITH_HOLYOAKE_2_DESC:0 "When 'ol Kiwi Keith entered politics more than thirty years ago, he didn't see himself ending up in the state's highest office. When he first became Prime Minister right before National's defeat, he never thought he would return to win four elections in a row, but that has happened.\n\nBut over these past years, what change has truly occurred in New Zealand? Sure, he cemented the creation of a New Zealander national identity separate from Britain, but wasn't such an invention a necessity in a post-war world? Maybe, it is the lack of change he will be remembered for, for conserving what makes New Zealand great in the face of great change.\n\nOr will he be remembered for the change he brought across the globe? His crusade against fascism helped to topple plenty of dictatorial regimes, ushering in new eras of democracy in a world that seems to increasingly shun it. Will it be the Organization of Free Nations who will write his epitaph once his career finally comes to an end?\n\nHolyoake can only say "hopefully", as everywhere else, his dogged conservatism appears increasingly out of place. As the years pass by, he can only the question of "how will it all end?" back and forth in his head. Always, the answer that returns to him is "grim"."
 POLITICS_BRIAN_TALBOYS_2_DESC:0 "A bright new day dawns for New Zealand as the realities of a new decade sets in. Past the economic woes of yesterday, Talboys looks to the rising growth of tomorrow in glee. He just hopes it stays that way.\n\nRaised in a traditional Christian household, Brian Talboys enjoyed a proper upbringing, afforded all the middle-class luxuries he could desire in education and other matters. When the war broke out, Talboys enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, staying close but not too close to danger as the old world fell apart for the new order.\n\nAfter the war, he became a farmer, a profession that led him to the National Party. As an MP, he ascended the political ladder with ease thanks to his inability to displease, considered an affable and mild figure. Talboys made connections in all the right places as his National peers continued to be impressed with his work. Most assumed he didn't have the backbone to be a leader, but here he is today.\n\nNow, sitting in a secure position as Prime Minister, Talboys has his work cut out for him. The Oil Crisis may be fading into the background, but its problems still linger, problems only hard graft can fix. Luckily, Mr. Talboys is no stranger to hard graft, as he prepares to build the New Zealand of tomorrow."
 POLITICS_ROBERT_MULDOON_2_DESC:0 "Robert Muldoon has been compared to many people during his time in power. These include Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Richard Nixon, and Keith Holyoake. Yet for his loyal supporters, he's just Rob, and he's here to stay.\n\nA conservative man, Robert's rule has shown his preference for little change in areas. For instance, the welfare state has largely been kept intact and enhanced for the benefit of older New Zealanders despite the protests from the more liberal side of his party. One wonders if Muldoon is too soft to even think of hurting someone by cutting welfare.\n\nHowever, such a thought is unlikely to be reconciled with Muldoon's egregious military interventions. In West Africa, Kiwi troops fought men who lived half a world away for a government they never knew. The same took place in Iran and Iraq. Were all the people they fought fascists? For the National Party, the easy answer is yes — the only answer — the government-approved answer.\n\nFor Rob's mob, they'll happily lap up this answer alongside everything else he says. Muldoon's the man; anyone who goes against him is probably a lily-livered liberal, a queer, or a fascist. As far as they are concerned, they would happily see him rule for twenty more years, as would Muldoon."
 # Labour Party
 POLITICS_NORMAN_KIRK_DESC:0 "New Zealand can't dedicate herself to fixing the problems of the world when she is already wracked with enough problems. Kirk knows this, Labour knows this, and now, the voters know this simple truth.\n\nNorman Kirk has been well-acquainted with this reality ever since enduring a childhood of poverty, saved only by his father performing back-breaking relief work to sustain his family. An avid learner yet unable to perform well in school, he chose to leave at the age of 13, working a variety of manual jobs to make ends meet.\n\nJoining Labour in 1943, he quickly rose through the ranks thanks to his diligence and careful study of electoral issues, reaching a new milestone in 1954 upon his election to parliament. Remaining as a backbencher during the Nash government, he avoided the public backlash Labour faced during this period, maintaining and gaining personal popularity thanks to his working-class roots.\n\nDethroning Nordmeyer with the help of the party's left, Kirk has now manoeuvred himself to the post of Prime Minister thanks to Holyoake's foreign policy failings, fancies Kirk has no wish to indulge in. Instead, he finds himself with a party and nation to tend to, both needing to be managed carefully to avoid either the radicals or conservatives taking hold."
 POLITICS_HUGH_WATT_DESC:0 "As more Kiwis return home in bodybags — without legs, or arms, or hopes — a reaction to these horrors was expected. Hugh Watt is the face of this reaction.\n\nBorn in Australia but only ever knowing New Zealand as his home, he grew up with a background in engineering. Naturally, he earned his bread and butter as an engineer, where he first encountered trade unionism after registering as a card-carrying member. It wasn't surprising when Watt followed this up by joining Labour; the surprise came by how far he ascended its ranks.\n\nDuring the fifties, he moved up to chair his constituency's Labour Representation Committee alongside becoming a member of Labour's national executive. After a brief knockback in the 1951 elections, he was elected an MP in a 1953 by-election. In the ill-fated Nash government, he served with distinction as Minister of Works, winning praise for his genial attitude.\n\nWatt embodies a contrast from his predecessor Kirk's more conservative positions. Already, he has won praise for his commitment against sending any more of New Zealand's young men to die in America's wars, something which has won him praise from a growing left-wing he needs to please. But whether or not New Zealand misses war is a matter for the next election..."
 POLITICS_MARTYRN_FINLAY_DESC:0 "Not many men find themselves practically pushed into a leadership role, especially in politics. Martyn Finlay is one of those rare men, championed by Labour's young and bold as a rallying figurehead, a testament to his work towards fixing New Zealand's social ills.\n\nThe son of missionaries, his life was shaped by poverty and tragedy, both arriving at the tender age of two when his father passed away. Economic realities would continue to intrude into his life, ending his ambitions as a doctor when he had to leave school at sixteen. Eventually, he received a scholarship to the London School of Economics, where he first got a taste for politics.\n\nNurtured by British Labour intellectuals, a flower began to bloom, returning home full of vigor. Becoming an MP in the forties, his parliamentary place would twist and turn, but never his passion for social reform. As Labour searched for a new leader to guide them, they turned to Finlay, a man of old Labour — but with views suitable for a young Labour — he delivered against all the odds.\n\nA Prime Minister uncomfortable with the people, Finlay would have rathered to remain in his own corners. But when such a golden opportunity presents itself, a chance to put his socially liberal views into legislation, how could he refuse? Yet already, he faces resistance from the conservatives of Labour. Will his premiership prove to be a bridge too far to bear?"
 POLITICS_BOB_TIZARD_DESC:0 "As New Zealanders stumble out of the doldrums its National predecessors have left them in, they realize change is needed more than ever, radical change. Bob Tizard is just the man for the job.\n\nGrowing up in Auckland, Tizard was treated with an excellent education. He proved to be an apt student bar a wartime interruption, where he joined the Air Force in a vain attempt to turn the tide. Returning to university, he got his first taste for politics in student associations. Later, he became involved in trade unionism, the catalyst for his Labour membership.\n\nAfter several failed attempts, Tizard joined the ranks of parliament as an MP, serving as a diligent backbencher. As Labour began to embrace socialism, he did too, seeing which way the winds were blowing. When Finlay resigned as leader in 1969, Tizard put his name forward. In the tight leadership that followed, he scored a narrow victory, just in time to take advantage of National's catastrophe.\n\nTizard may have ambitious goals as Prime Minister, but as far as he is concerned, New Zealand needs the drastic change he promises. National's half-measures have only led to a dying economy, unemployment running rife, and the nation's social fabric faltering. Under his watch, there will be no more half-measures, only full prescriptions to return his country to life."
 POLITICS_NORMAN_KIRK_2_DESC:0 "Politics is a game of balance, each faucet of society tugging at you, screaming for their interests to be represented. Kirk's party is only a microcosm of this, two wings content to tear him apart to get what they want. Were he a lesser man, he would have crumbled years ago.\n\nWhile some criticize Prime Minister Norman Kirk for the relatively slow speed of his reforms to Kiwi society, compared to the years of conservatism that preceded him, his pace seems almost revolutionary in comparison. Compulsory trade unionism has been set in stone as the welfare state has been thoroughly rebuffed after its weakening during the years of National Party rule.\n\nYet still, the accusations of conservatism persist, especially when he shies away from even the term "socialism" that so many others within the party have embraced. His latent social conservatism continues to creep into policymaking, coupled with an unseemly paranoia that makes him a reclusive figure past his surface-level bombastic personality.\n\nBut even more pressing is the topic of his health. Big Norm finds himself doing the work of ten men at a time, despite medical advice to the contrary, a matter not helped at all by poor diet and severe weight. If something does not change, Labour may find itself without its leading light sooner rather than later."
 POLITICS_HUGH_WATT_2_DESC:0 "When Hugh Watt first entered New Zealand's highest office back in 1966, the people were tired of war. Some thought this was only a phase, yet as Watt returns to power consistently, perhaps the people of New Zealand have finally given peace a chance.\n\nOf course, non-intervention wasn't his only policy during his many years of rule. During his reign as Prime Minister, Hugh Watt has given New Zealand back to the workers. While his opponents to the left of him criticize his work as only half-measures, he knows better than to listen to communists. The New Zealand he is building is not a failed Soviet state but a democracy.\n\nHowever, even in his most boastful moods, Watt is aware that there is still so much left to be done. The task of building socialism is not one accomplished in a matter of years but a matter of decades. Injustice and inequality have not been abolished, still lurking in the corners of factories, where workers continue to be denied their fair share for their labor.\n\nUltimately, he realizes that he will not be the one who achieves the socialist dream. Watt feels his bones creak, time catching up to him each day. And in his office, the Prime Minister thinks about it as he ponders a vital question: "Who will carry on my work?""

 # Social Credit Party
 POLITICS_JOHN_OBRIEN_DESC:0 "When Social Credit's Executive replaced the stiff Vernon Cracknell for the charismatic John O'Brien, they were certain they had found someone more pliable to their demands. Time will prove them wrong.\n\nFor most of his life, O'Brien was a figure of little renown. He grew up in the backdrop of World War Two, watching beautiful Britannia and the old order crumble into pieces at the hands of horrific force. However, the Britain that returned piqued his interest, one part in particular. In 1945, the world saw its first-ever Social Creditist Prime Minister with Hastings Russell, Duke of Bedford.\n\nWhile Russell would come far short of the dream, his ideas inspired O'Brien to join New Zealand's own Social Credit Party. A powerful speaker and an energetic worker, he did well within the organization, becoming Deputy Leader in 1960. The sixties would also see him earn a seat in parliament, where he proved himself a vicious critic of successive governments.\n\nBut now, the critic must step into the role himself. He stands upon a shaky coalition, but one he will do his utmost to make the most of. Absolute economic security will be guaranteed, purchasing power will be restored, and each citizen shall receive their national dividend. Should anything come in between him and his goals, the consequences will be dire."

 NZL_Culture_War:0 "The Culture War - Anglo Dominance"
 NZL_Culture_War_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the New Zealand economy flows from the Pacific. Imports, particularly from American markets, are crucial to New Zealand's economy. Thus, American culture often finds outsized influence against local culture.\n\nAt present, the Union Jack still flies proudly over New Zealand. British culture remains dominant. Still, we hear those snide whispers when our backs are turned. Are we truly the 'White Trash of the Pacific?' Or are we simply bold enough to retain our traditions?"
 NZL_Culture_War_2:0 "The Culture War - Waning Anglo Influence"
 NZL_Culture_War_2_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the New Zealand economy flows from the Pacific. Imports, particularly from American markets, are crucial to New Zealand's economy. Thus, American culture often finds outsized influence against local culture.\n\nHowever, the Union Jack still hangs high over New Zealand, but some have begun to question why. A new generation is born with no recollection of why Britain is so great beyond their parents' praise. To an increasing number of people, it is just another island on the other side of the world."
 NZL_Culture_War_3:0 "The Culture War - The Best of Both Worlds"
 NZL_Culture_War_3_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the New Zealand economy flows from the Pacific. Imports, particularly from American markets, are crucial to New Zealand's economy. Thus, American culture often finds outsized influence against local culture.\n\nWhere the Union Jack once reigned without competition, the Stars and Stripes appear to be giving it a run for its money these days. American and British cultures fight for the hearts and minds of New Zealanders each day, becoming the topic of debate across public forums. Is this American obsession a fad, or is it the future?"
 NZL_Culture_War_4:0 "The Culture War - Growing American Influence"
 NZL_Culture_War_4_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the New Zealand economy flows from the Pacific. Imports, particularly from American markets, are crucial to New Zealand's economy. Thus, American culture often finds outsized influence against local culture.\n\nWhen American imports first started coming into New Zealand, they were considered an unwelcome means to an end. Nowadays, they are becoming the norm. The Anglo heirlooms — cherished by previous generations — are pushed to the side by more and more people by the year, tossed out like toys from a pram."
 NZL_Culture_War_5:0 "The Culture War - American Dominance"
 NZL_Culture_War_5_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the New Zealand economy flows from the Pacific. Imports, particularly from American markets, are crucial to New Zealand's economy. Thus, American culture often finds outsized influence against local culture.\n\nA new saying has emerged among the more cynical citizens — "In New Zealand, we import everything, even our culture." For some, this is just a sign of the times, a symbol of New Zealand's growing adolescence. Others scoff at this, calling out those who would so easily forsake their traditions for modern trinkets and fancies."

 NZL_Onto_World_Stage:0 "Onto the World Stage - Bearer of the Torch"
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_desc:0 "Whether you are the greatest superpower or the smallest observer, you must carry the torch of liberty across the entire globe. This is a cornerstone of New Zealand's current foreign policy, and it is reflected in their eagerness to join the OFN in crusades against fascism all over the world. Still, New Zealand is a small country, and its reach sometimes exceeds its grasp."
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_2:0 "Onto the World Stage - Kindler of the Flame"
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_2_desc:0 "The crusade against fascism is a noble one, but when undertaken by small countries, sometimes they can experience setbacks. New Zealand has experienced a knockback in its hawkish foreign policy, but it is only a temporary one. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. After all, you don't hang up the gloves after losing one fight."
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_3:0 "Onto the World Stage - Burnt by the Fire"
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_3_desc:0 "The crusade against fascism is not without its hardships, but these days, victory appears to be a fleeting thing for the average New Zealander. Where public opinion was once unanimously behind foreign intervention, more argue that New Zealand must look after herself instead of the whole world. The pacifist is no longer spat upon when they dare to speak, they are listened to."
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_4:0 "Onto the World Stage - Set Ablaze"
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_4_desc:0 "New Zealand has played with fire one too many times, and now, it is seeing the consequences. The crusade against fascism seems more and more like a farce, as fascism scores victory after victory against the forces of freedom. While the true believers still stand with the fight, the public is growing skeptical, questioning all this money sent overseas."
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_5:0 "Onto the World Stage - Warden of the Ashes"
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_5_desc:0 ""Hello [NZL.GetLeader], how many of our kids will you kill today?"\n\nThese chants have become commonplace in the streets as New Zealand's military adventures appear as nothing more than an embarrassment at best, and a naked drive for greed and imperialism at worst. Unless a major turnaround happens, the hawks and chickenhawks of New Zealand will soon become extinct."
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_6:0 "Onto the World Stage - Backstage"
 NZL_Onto_World_Stage_6_desc:0 "After so long fighting foreign wars for America, New Zealand's new government has decided to take a break from holding up the torch against fascism. For how long this will last, no one knows except those in power, and the voter. If this new government can convince people that peace is the answer, all is well. If they decide the crusade against fascism must be restarted, then their time in power is very limited."

 NZL_Social_Fabric:0 "The Social Fabric - Pristine"
 NZL_Social_Fabric_desc:0 "The social fabric of New Zealand holds the nation together, yet many dangers threaten to pull at it, stretch it, and rip it apart.\n\nFortunately, the tapestry at the foundation of New Zealand remains strong and unfrayed. The people are united and hopeful about the direction of our society. So long as our social fabric holds, our nation shall not fall into darkness and despair."
 NZL_Social_Fabric_2:0 "The Social Fabric - Worn"
 NZL_Social_Fabric_2_desc:0 "The social fabric of New Zealand holds the nation together, yet many dangers threaten to pull at it, stretch it, and rip it apart.\n\nNew Zealand's finely woven tapestry has experienced some hardship recently, but it is nothing if not durable. Some may question the government's intentions at times, skeptical about some of the decisions undertaken, but eventually realize that the men at the top know what they are doing, and rest easy."
 NZL_Social_Fabric_3:0 "The Social Fabric - Fractured"
 NZL_Social_Fabric_3_desc:0 "The social fabric of New Zealand holds the nation together, yet many dangers threaten to pull at it, stretch it, and rip it apart.\n\nThe tapestry of New Zealand is experiencing a transition, going from one solid piece to several pieces held together by the thinnest of threads, worn out by continued societal upheaval. The poor little island can only endure so much turmoil as its government continues to push it to the brink."
 NZL_Social_Fabric_4:0 "The Social Fabric - In Tatters"
 NZL_Social_Fabric_4_desc:0 "The social fabric of New Zealand holds the nation together, yet many dangers threaten to pull at it, stretch it, and rip it apart.\n\nOh beautiful New Zealand, what has happened to you... torn apart by the people who promised to keep you safe. The once-strong social fabric is left in rags — the people it was meant to represent in fury at the government — and the politicians flailing and unable to help."

 NZL_Establishment:0 "A More Harmonious Establishment"
 NZL_Establishment_desc:0 "Since the proclamation of self-governance in 1907, our government has sought to represent and benefit the good people of New Zealand. So far, Wellington has done a decent job: the government is stable, Parliament is cordial enough, and the people's faith in our political establishment is at an acceptable level. So long as this peace holds, New Zealand will remain a bastion of political stability for decades to come."
 NZL_Establishment_2:0 "The Abnormal New Normal"
 NZL_Establishment_2_desc:0 "Since the proclamation of self-governance in 1907, our government has sought to represent and benefit the good people of New Zealand. During these years, two dominant parties emerged to represent them, but now it has become clear that neither of these parties is equipped to govern them.\n\nThe new Social Creditist government has inherited this mantle, but not the political stability squandered long ago. For most, this was unforeseeable but a welcome change from the two tired old parties. However, some wonder how New Zealand's democratic institutions will change or if they will even remain institutions after this brave new change."
