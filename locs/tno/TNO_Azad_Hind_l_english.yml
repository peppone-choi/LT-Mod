 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_SUBHAS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC: "It seemed that societal fate would have had Subhas Chandra Bose, born into the family of a loyal servant of the Raj, work as one of those innumerable 'natives' without whom the British could not control the subcontinent. Instead, on the cusp of a successful entry into the prestigious Indian Civil Service, he threw it all away for the sake of serving a greater goal - his motherland, the much beleaguered Indian nation.\n\nAs one of several young, dynamic, and left-leaning voices within Congress that urged faster and more radical action, and despite being elected both to govern Kolkata and to Congress' highest offices, Bose soon found himself at odds with the party's slow and legalistic leadership. When the War broke out, concerned about his potential to disrupt the Raj, the British imprisoned him at home - only for him to escape in a scene straight out of a movie, hiding and disguising himself until he reached Afghanistan, where, with German aid, he reached the Soviet Union. Finding the European powers unwilling to help, he finally turned to Japan for aid, organizing an army of Indian prisoners-of-war and proclaiming that he would march to Delhi. Almost concurrently, the Raj itself collapsed.\n\nInvited to form a united government, Bose happily accepted - only to be blamed for the failings of the war against Afghanistan and nearly imprisoned again. But Bengal and the East were now loyal to the HSS, not Congress, and he escaped once more. Now he waits, determined to march to Delhi once more whether in peace, or by war. The hour that will decide the fate of all India is soon at hand - and he will be the one to guide it there."
 POLITICS_MOHAN_SINGH_DESC: "General Mohan Singh sits as provisional President of India at the head of a council that is most assuredly committed to restoring democratic governance, after a long and distinguished career in service to Subhas Chandra Bose and the people of India.\n\nAt the start, Singh was a captain in the Indian army posted to Malaya. When the Japanese stormed into that colony, Singh was befriended by Captain Fujiwara Iwaichi, who convinced him to start an army for Indian independence out of the ranks of captured soldiers. Things were destabilized by the IJA headquarters and the withdrawal of Fujiwara until Subhas Chandra Bose came around and led the Azad Hind Fauj to victory.\n\nAfter the war, Mohan Singh's joy at the liberation of India slowly turned to discontent. Especially after Subhas Chandra Bose began to show signs of old age, Singh was sidelined in the army, leading him to dissent against the government. But once Bose passed on and figures such as Kiani were sidelined, things fell to chaos, giving Singh reason to take direct action to stabilize the Indian government and put an end to the mess left by Bose's unworthy successors.\n\nAs order is restored, Mohan Singh wants you to know one thing: he is committed to democracy. Very committed, one hundred percent. The restoration of sound governance will surely culminate in a proper constitutional and democratic government, you may rest assured."
 POLITICS_LAKSHMI_SAHGAL_DESC: "Lakshmi Sahgal, respected as "Captain Lakshmi" even in the republican west of India, can hardly credit that she was able to become President. But perhaps this is exactly what the hard-working women and diligent workers of India need as they face the new millennium.\n\nSahgal was a militant for Indian independence even before she had the surname Sahgal. Arriving in Malaya after a failed marriage, she joined the Indian National Army and served on the frontlines against the British as Captain commanding the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. Retiring as a brigadier, the first woman promoted to such a rank since the arrival of the British, she went to work in politics while building on her studies as an obstetrician and gynaecologist. It was at this time that Sahgal became certain that socialist and left-wing politics were the way forward for India.\n\nPerhaps it was her military service and the connections it engendered that made her a suitable candidate for the Presidency. Her husband General Prem Kumar Sahgal aside, she also had the friendship of leaders of the grassroots, stay-behind All India Forward Bloc, which had remained behind in India during the Second World War. It was people such as Sardul Singh Cavesheer and more importantly Sheel Bhadra Yajee that provided her the backing she needed to get her grounding in the HSS in the 40s and 50s, then succeed as minister of women's organization in the 60s, and, later on, become president.\n\nAs President, Lakshmi Sahgal's primary goals are ambitious. She wants wide-ranging legislation and policy changes to promote a fairer shake for women, so they might have the opportunities she did, and to strengthen the workers and farmers of India, on whom its prosperity so strongly relies."
 POLITICS_SAMAR_GUHA_DESC: "People always squabble over Subhas Chandra Bose's legacy. Some of these say that his legacy is solely military in nature and that his truest followers unified the Subcontinent by force. Others claim that his legacy is in introducing the advancements of Japanese culture and technology to the Indian people. Still others—such as the former medical doctor Samar Guha — consider economic justice on socialist and populist lines to be Netaji's bequest to the Indian people.\n\nWhile Bose was still alive, the socialist intellectual Guha was one of his closest confidants. Despite his intellectual bearing, he is a popular figure, elevated to that position by Bose as a close friend to him both publicly and privately.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that Samar Guha is devoutly committed on a personal level to the furtherance of Bose's legacy as he sees it. Guha's policy priorities—the ways by which he will ensure that Netaji's legacy as he understands it persists—are threefold: robust education, a strong social safety net, and a powerful national defense.\n\nWhile in office, Guha will have a lot of resources to draw from. A bookish man, he pores over variegated topics as far apart as atomic science and the traditional philosophy, religion, and culture of the Subcontinent. He balances reading interpretations of Bose's ideology with a long list of books pertaining to mainstream socialist theory. But time will tell whether all this reading will be as beneficial to the Indian people as it has been to Guha's own edification."
 POLITICS_AMIYA_NATH_BOSE_DESC: "The ascension of Amiya Nath Bose to the post once held by his late uncle is raising accusations of nepotism—assertions that he is struggling to defeat.\n\nWhen Bose was leading a student union at Calcutta University, he might not have expected such a fate. In 1937 he went to Cambridge to study economics, and was called to the Bar in 1941. The British kept him under surveillance much like they did his father and uncle, suspecting him of radical anti-imperialism. Such an accusation was only brought to reality when the British government collapsed under the pressure of Operation Sea Lion, Bose went home, and found himself at his uncle and father's side as the Raj fell apart.\n\nThe years wore on. India was split into two. Bose's father, Sarat Chandra Bose, passed on. To honor his father's memory and comfort his grieving uncle, Amiya Nath Bose kept on working to further the HSS's interests. The Fifties became the Sixties, Subhas Chandra Bose looked wearier and wearier—and then, all of a sudden, Amiya Nath Bose was ushered into a room and told that his uncle was no more and that he was now President.\n\nThe ascension of Amiya Nath Bose to the post of President has raised allegations of nepotism. In his heart of hearts, Bose doesn't mind. He lacks charisma; he believes he cannot change the narrative. Besides, as far as Amiya Nath Bose envisions the future, he is only a transitional president. Why should he care what people think of him, if he is to hand off power eventually?"
 POLITICS_ANAND_MOHAN_SAHAY_DESC: "The young Anand Mohan Sahay was a devotee of the monotheistic Hindu reform movement known as Arya Samaj, which condemns statues of the gods as "murti puja", idolatry. He found himself with a gang of friends in front of an idol which they wished to destroy. His friends, cowed by a last-minute attack of fear, fled for their lives. Sahay took three steps forward, smashed the idol to pieces, and watched the other youths flee.\n\nAs a young independence activist Sahay found himself marooned in Japan, his passport revoked by Britain while he was en route to the United States. He wrote to Nehru and Rajendra Prasad, who gave him hard advice: contact other independentists and help the cause from Japan. He took the advice, settled in Kobe, and through a network of Indian contacts in Japan and publications in English and Japanese made himself second only to Rash Behari Bose as the face of Indian liberation in Japan.\n\nServing as Subhas Chandra Bose's secretary and then foreign minister, Sahay shadowed his leader across Singapore, Burma, Bengal, Delhi. He forged contacts with all kinds of people. Others nervously hoped for Indians to be treated as equals; Sahay demanded it. With rhetorical fire and personal connections honed by focusing on talking to the ignored, he attained what he desired.\n\nToday Sahay is responsible for the whole of India. His belief in its total transformation persists undimmed. He supports Bose's anticolonial project, but also advocates closer ties with Japan and Manchukuo."
 POLITICS_AC_CHATTERJI_DESC: "If you told Doctor Anil Chandra Chattopadhyay in 1915 that in thirty years he would be a major-general in the army of a Free India, he might have started checking you for exhaustion. Yet that was exactly what took place—that is the path Dr. A. C. Chatterji's life took when he joined Subhas Chandra Bose in the 1940s.\n\nIf you told Chatterji that he was to become a minister of finance and a chief administrator of liberated territories, he would be even more incredulous. But that was the task that he was given—stewarding the finances of the Kolkata government and administering territories taken from the British until a permanent administration could be brought about.\n\nIf you told him that a certain minister of finances would be removed from his position as a result of student strikes over food insecurity, but instead given promotion and made the head of his party, he might be outraged. But in 1959, that was exactly what happened—Chatterji was made to hand over his finance ministry to Nedyam Raghavan and was made president of the HSS.\n\nIf you told the young doctor that he was to become president after moving upwards in that fashion, and to become notorious for his advanced age and opportunism, he might at last come around and begin to think it plausible. After all, if there is such a chance to secure one's old age like that, why wouldn't one take it?"
 POLITICS_NEDYAM_RAGHAVAN_DESC: "Decades ago, Nedyam Raghavan was an Indian immigrant to Malaysia, working as a lawyer in Penang and energetically defending laborers in court. Then the World War began, the Japanese came, and Raghavan joined hands with Rash Behari Bose to organize the Indian Independence League.\n\nBut Iwakuro Hideo replaced a friendlier liaison and screwed things up, imposing his own will on the Indian revolutionaries and demanding blind submission. The enraged Raghavan resigned and accepted house arrest, refusing to sell the Indian independence movement out to Tokyo.\n\nThat could have been the end of it, until Subhas Chandra Bose came back. Bose realized that Raghavan, who he had disagreed with beforehand on the question of working with the INC, had the hearts of the Indians of Malaya. He thus entreated him to rejoin the INA; Raghavan agreed and immediately arranged a flood of funds from the south Indian communities in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe war was won. Raghavan served as an ambassador and a finance minister. A ferocious orator, he was respected and feared as one of the prime rhetoricians of the Kolkata government. With that pedigree it came as no surprise that he would take over as President after Bose's death.\n\nAs President, Raghavan's priorities are threefold: pan-Asianism, though within limits; welfarism and a social safety net; last but not least, a strongly developmentalist economic program."
 POLITICS_ABID_HASAN_SAFRANI_DESC: "Abid Hasan Safrani, born in Hyderabad and educated in Germany, has already left a mark on the Indian psyche regardless of where his political career takes him—for it was him that popularized the slogan Jai Hind across the Subcontinent.\n\nSafrani served as personal secretary and interpreter to Subhas Chandra Bose for decades after having met him during the Second World War. He is thus well-known for his loyalty to Netaji, a loyalty that made Safrani fear for the party's welfare under Chatterji and led him to have Chatterji ousted.\n\nContrary to stereotypes about technically trained professionals, Safrani is remarkably well-read. Fluent in Arabic, German, Farsi, and English, he lived in Mahatma Gandhi's Gujarat ashram before joining Bose. Safrani is unmarried, though he did have an unrequited romance with a German woman in the Forties. Though a religious Shi'ite Muslim—and thus a poster boy for Indian secularism—he drinks frequently. Having served in the INA himself, with the rank of Major, he was involved in trying to frame the INA as a very ideological army, a matter that met with mixed success.\n\nOn the other hand, his stints in the Azad Hind diplomatic service after the War were much more successful and may be one reason why his removal of Chatterji was successful. Now Safrani has assumed responsibility for the security of India and will lead the country in his mentor's absence."

 ### Ideas ###
 AZH_Hindustan_Land_Development_Authority: "Hindustan Land Development Authority"
 AZH_Hindustan_Land_Development_Authority_desc: "With the stated goal of resettling landless peasants and improving agricultural productivity, HILDA's operations in the Northeast of the country have brought mixed results. While the redistribution of land has significantly alleviated tenancy concerns in overpopulated Bengal and created a new source of government revenue, it has also caused an increase in secessionist and local nationalist sentiment in the areas with the most planned settlements."
 AZH_The_Language_Problem: "The Language Problem"
 AZH_The_Language_Problem_desc: "The government and Party are led overwhelmingly by either ethnic Bengalis, or expatriate Tamils from the communities in Malaya and Burma that formed the core of the movement. This, along with Bose's desire to Romanize and standardize Hindustani as the official government language, causes tension in both Bengal and the Hindi-speaking parts of the country."
 AZH_What_Is_Subhasism: "What is Subhasism?"
 AZH_What_Is_Subhasism_desc: "Socialism, nationalism, bolshevism, fascism - the officially espoused ideology of the Azad Hind has been called many things, but even the most ardent Party member would be hard pressed to pin down the precise position of the government and people. This ideological flexibility is useful perhaps only in negotiations with other countries (and certain insurgent groups), but sooner or later a decision must be reached and Bose's vision must be laid down in concrete terms. As to the form this will take, it's anyone's guess."

 AZH_The_Crossroads_of_the_Subhasist_Revolution: "The Crossroads of the Subhasist Revolution"
 AZH_The_Crossroads_of_the_Subhasist_Revolution_desc: "Kolkata stands as the birthplace of a new revolution - rooted in nationalism, secularism, and the unstoppable march to modernity, led by the disciplined ranks of the Hindustan Samyavadhi Sangha. Subhasism is the watchword that dominates this new nation, and until India herself no longer stands at the precipice of total war, the HSS will guard it - and every other institution - with the utmost diligence. The party is the state, and the state is the party."
 AZH_A_New_Hammer_for_Old_Problems: "A New Hammer for Old Problems"
 AZH_A_New_Hammer_for_Old_Problems_desc: "At the onset of the new administration, Bengal found herself united but still overburdened by landless peasants desperate for work. Simultaneously, the Northeast grappled with dual loyalties and insidious wreckers keen on ripping apart the unity of the nation. HILDA - the Hindustan Land Redevelopment Authority - seeks to solve both problems by resettling the rural poor into state-organised colonies selling cash crops, inspired by the Manchurian model. While this has inflamed the Northeast insurgents to the point of armed conflict, state control of the borderlands has increased - for now, the situation remains under our control"
 AZH_The_Old_Ghosts_of_Communalism: "The Old Ghosts of Communalism"
 AZH_The_Old_Ghosts_of_Communalism_desc: "Despite Bose's ideals, the long shadow of India's past continues to lurk behind every attempt at reaching her future. Casteism remains widespread, and though religious tensions have calmed, watchful eyes look suspiciously at every attempt to secularise the state. In the Northeast insurgents attempt to carve away parts of the state, while in the rest of the country the movement for language-based states gains power. The old ghosts of communalism will never stop haunting our people until we exorcize them for good - and with every passing day the temptation is greater to burn them out with force."
 AZH_Thirteen_Years_of_Progress: "Thirteen Years of Progress"
 AZH_Thirteen_Years_of_Progress_desc: "At the time of the ignominious exit of the British Raj, India was nearly two hundred years behind the developed nations. Now, thirteen years later, the giant has begun to wake, and her huddled millions rush into the factories and the farms. Azad Hind's Five-Year Plans have so far been focused entirely on the development of militarised heavy industry, massive investment into schools, hospitals, and other requirements of a modern society, and - in the background - the birth of an export-based economy to support the Northeastern settlers.\n\nThe present third Plan, instead, has slowed down the pace of military industry, instead attempting to substitute consumer goods from Japan and increase the standard of living. However, if a more pressing need were to arise..."
 AZH_Frontline_of_Anti_Imperialism: "Frontline of Anti-Imperialism"
 AZH_Frontline_of_Anti_Imperialism_desc: "The hawk-eyed bureaucrats in Tokyo and the struggling masses of the oppressed world both gaze watchfully at one man - Subhas Chandra Bose. Simultaneously, Bose represents the hope of a strong, independent partner in Japan's New Order, and the vigour of an anti-imperialist icon - a man that defied the established power with force, and liberated his people.\n\nThese two forces pull at opposite ends, and so far it is primarily the force of his personality that keeps them together - Kolkata sees shipments of arms and volunteers to colonial struggles to the West, and meetings with the Sphere to the East. For now the two are balanced, but time will tell with whom Azad Hind truly stands with."

 AZH_Old_Wine_in_a_New_Bottle: "Old Wine in a New Bottle"
 AZH_Old_Wine_in_a_New_Bottle_desc: "In the aftermath of the great Netaji's passing his chosen successor, A.C. Chatterji, notes the well-worn path he trod for the nation with pride. It would be a fool's errand to break what has worked so far, and so the nation will continue to aim for economic self-sufficiency within a close partnership with Japan. State-directed heavy industry, political control of trade unions, and some economic planning will form the backbone that will lead the nation into its greatest years yet."
 AZH_A_Gentle_Leviathan: "A Gentle Leviathan"
 AZH_A_Gentle_Leviathan_desc: "Raghavan envisions an India born anew, one prioritising economic development and social welfare. A combination of state-led initiatives to expand education, healthcare, and infrastructure with centralised economic planning, and close cooperation with emerging financial backers from his bamboo network across South East Asia will see the nation grow without chopping off its own roots."
 AZH_The_Revolution_in_Sight: "The Revolution in Sight"
 AZH_The_Revolution_in_Sight_desc: "The hero of the Rani of Jhansi regiment sees only one way for the nations' future — revolutionary socialism. She will dismantle entrenched hierarchies, seek comprehensive wealth redistribution, and empower the working men and women of the nation to establish a truly egalitarian society.\n\nWhile the Captain's deep red policies inspire fervent support from the oppressed and the downtrodden, they also invite suspicion from Japan — suspicion that only her own history and fiery personal brand of leadership can keep under check. Should Tokyo consider decide this revolutionary is nothing more than a crypto-Marxist, her time in government will likely be cut short, painfully so."
 AZH_Everything_According_to_Plan: "Everything According to Plan"
 AZH_Everything_According_to_Plan_desc: "Bose's strongest soldier will embrace what he saw as his legacy with unwavering fidelity - and will see India transformed with total state planning and the ambition to challenge nature with the strength of labour. His government will direct immense resources into monumental projects and massive industrial complexes, whilst championing a secular and modernist domestic policy that regards tradition as a relic of the past only to be remembered fondly. India will break bounds, split the atom, cast itself into the sky, and emerge once and for all from the long shadow of Britain's imperialism."
 AZH_A_Thousand_Promises: "A Thousand Promises"
 AZH_A_Thousand_Promises_desc: "The INA has spoken, and there are none to oppose it. With Singh's "interim" junta in power, an uncertain future awaits, marked by vague promises of liberalisation and socialism. Some expect the loosening of state control and the growth of private companies guarded by the strength of the Army. Others predict the growth of the welfare state with the aim of placating the people. Only one thing is for certain - the military is in charge, and the legacy of an apolitical armed force inherited from the British is forever dead. From now on, any civilian government will have to tread carefully under the watchful gaze of India's self-appointed protectors."
 AZH_Nation_and_Labour: "Nation and Labour"
 AZH_Nation_and_Labour_desc: "Under Guha's leadership, the Indian economy will be driven by one great partnership at its core - that between industry and organised labour. Trade unions and worker's councils will play a central role in decision-making right alongside state planners and technocratic advisors, ensuring that labour interests will not only be represented but actively involved in key decisions. Though Japanese advisors balk, supposedly at the creation of a new monster of bureaucracy that interferes with economic activity, it could also be said that they simply find themselves stonewalled against spreading their tendrils in another developing nation."
 AZH_The_Inheritance_of_Doctrine: "The Inheritance of Doctrine"
 AZH_The_Inheritance_of_Doctrine_desc: "A Bose remains in power, and it certainly looks that way. Continuing on the late Netaji's polices of personalist intervention from the executive in all aspects of governance, Amiya Nath Bose has assembled a new cabinet of close advisors that seek the promoting of their projects at the expense of others. However, following in the footsteps of his uncle, the new Bose also seeks populist support - though his mild-mannered personality lacks the force of his predecessor, he will instead use populist policies and regular rallies to gradually ensure the party remains in power - with him at its centre."
 AZH_A_Titan_of_the_Sphere: "A Titan of the Sphere"
 AZH_A_Titan_of_the_Sphere_desc: "Drawing inspiration from the successes of Manchukuo, Sahay's regime openly embraces an economic model driven by a cadre of social-bureaucrats who see authoritarian oversight and economic planning as key. Backed by the Indian National Army, the Hindustani Development Agency - a new zaibatsu organised along the lines of Mangyo - will tightly control development, pulling in investment from Japan to create a new titan of Asian industry."
 AZH_Only_the_Best: "Only the Best"
 AZH_Only_the_Best_desc: "The nation is a machine, and who better to direct it than the military? The Indian economy will be forged through a synergy of military discipline and civilian expertise. Strategic industries will be managed by a collaboration between skilled technocrats and experienced military planners. Infrastructure projects and industrial expansion will be championed and will bolster both economic output and national security. Critics may see a nation marching straight into the jaws of a civilian dictatorship, but the people see it for what it is - a streamlined approach to modernisation."

 AZH_black_years_dynamic_modifier: "The Black Years"
 AZH_black_years_dynamic_modifier_desc: "The basic necessity of food does not pause during wartime. Amidst the havoc experienced across India, this fact is the first to be forgotten, but once bellies go empty, it is very quickly remembered.\n\nNow, there is famine like never before. The destruction wrought on the agricultural heartlands of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh has already had grave consequences: for every death in combat, 20 more die by starvation. Villages across the country howl in pain from damage by their own countrymen. If nothing is done, the Black Years will become not just a national, but a global tragedy: it will be suffering to a scale yet unmatched this century."
