The §DThird German Antarctic Expedition§!, captained by §gAlfred Ritscher§!, set sail for §WAntarctica§! aboard the §gMS Schwabenland§!, with the goal of finding a location for a whaling station, and searching for possible locations for a naval base. The crew arrived in §VQueen Maud Land§!, a section of the continent already claimed by §VNorway§!, and struck their own claim to the region as they carried out the duties of the expedition, mapping thousands of square kilometers of §WAntarctic§! ice. As the §gMS Schwabenland§! returned to §rthe Fatherland§! in February of 1939, the small and relatively secret expedition faded from memory, as §eWorld War Two§! and its aftermath gripped the world. For the next decade, §WAntarctica§! sat undisturbed, far away from the chaos.\n\nWhat started out as a small dispute between §MArgentina§! and §RChile§! over the status of several formerly §xBritish§! islands in the §BWeddell Sea§! quickly evolved into the §iScramble for Antarctica§!, as the three major powers quickly rushed to secure their slice of the §WAntarctic§! pie. The §DThird German Antarctic Expedition§!, once nearly forgotten, now served to cement §rthe Reich's§! claim to §WAntarctica§!, along with the former §VNorwegian§! claim, which was relinquished to them by the now-§rReichskommissariat§! §VNorwegen§!. §VQueen Maud Land§! was formally renamed to §rNeuschwabenland§!, §VPrince Olav Coast§! to §rAdolf Hitler Coast§!, §VPrincess Martha Coast§! to §rEva Hitler Coast§!, and a §ocivilian administration§! was established to attempt to colonize the region.\n\nThe fledgling §WAntarctic§! bases were stricken with supply shortages during their short lifespan, and the situation only worsened with the outbreak of the §eWest Russian War§!, which also served as the final nail in the coffin for both the colonists and §rthe Reich's§! attempts to colonize the harsh §WAntarctic§! lands. Following the end of the war, the territory was reorganized into the current §rmilitary administration§!, under the leadership of §gLuftwaffe Oberstleutnant Rudolf Mayr§!, who, decades ago, was one of the pilots for the §DThird German Antarctic Expedition§!. §rNeuschwabenland§! now functions as a §gLuftwaffe Erprobungsstelle§!, or testing site, for §gexperimental aircraft§! and, more recently, §Knuclear weapons§!.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* Develop and test §gcutting-edge aircraft§! to aid in §rthe Reich's§! future endeavors\n\n* Manage secretive §Knuclear tests§! conducted by §sHerr Professor Doktor Schumann§!\n\n* Keep §rNeuschwabenland§! functioning in the face of §osupply shortages§! and §einstability§! back home"
  COUNTRY_INFO_AAO:0 "§G==THE OFN ANTARCTIC ADMINISTRATION==§!\n\nPrior to the §iScramble for Antarctica§!, §eAmerica's§! last efforts in §WAntarctica§! were in §Y1940§!, with the §DUnited States Antarctic Service Expedition§!, the third expedition run by §gRear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd§!. §gByrd§! was the driving force behind the majority of the §eUnited States'§! efforts on the southern continent, and his passion for §WAntarctica§! even led to him being invited by §gAlfred Ritscher§! on the §DThird German Antarctic Expedition§! (which he declined due to rising tensions).

 AAA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Argentina's activity in the Antarctic dates back to the early 1900s, with the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and several small huts scattered on the outlying island. Following the defeat of the Allies in the Second World War, Britain's Antarctic claim was up for grabs, and several years later, Argentina tried to do just that. They also attempted to declare sovereignty over several small islands which held now-defunct British stations, that were within the region claimed by Chile. The Chileans raised a diplomatic dispute, the United States got involved, and the Scramble for Antarctica began.\n\nFollowing the negotiations, Argentina received a sizable portion of their claimed lands, but disputes with Chile still remained over control of parts of the former British claim. The 1958 Snipe War saw negotiations collapse due to the Argentinean Navy seizing this disputed region, leaving Argentina with a large swath of territory in Antarctica and a very angry Chilean Antarctic Territory to their west."
 
 AAB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Ahnenerbe Antarktis Gruppe is the most recent addition to the Antarctic continent, operating out of a small base in western Neuschwabenland, founded several years after the creation of SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. While not technically an Antarctic territory like the other five on the continent, the Ahnenerbe and other SS members stationed in Antarctica have no plans to take orders from Mayr. Led by long-time Ahnenerbe Reichsgeschäftsführer Wolfram Sievers, the men at Begerheim take orders from Himmler alone. \n\nCurrently the only portion of the Ahnenerbe doing field research, their goals are simple: conduct expeditions and experiments to scientifically prove the superiority of the Aryan race, and discover evidence to support the theory of World Ice Doctrine. Sievers and his men hope that they can unlock the secrets buried beneath the Antarctic ice, for he and the rest of the SS in Antarctica know that returning to Burgundy empty-handed is not an option."
 
 AAC_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The history of Chile's activity in Antarctica begins in the early twentieth century with the establishment of a small port on the South Shetland Islands for sealers and whalers. Unfortunately for the Chilean government, the British plastered a claim to Antarctica directly across where the Chilean claim would lie decades later.\n\nDespite formally staking their claim three years prior to the Argentineans, the Scramble for Antarctica ended with the Argentineans getting the majority of the British claim, thanks to the hastily conducted negotiations. The Chileans lost even more territory in the aftermath of the Snipe War, with Argentina seizing the disputed territory between the two. The current head of the Chilean Antarctic Territory, Julio Escudero Guzmán, fought to enforce the Chilean claim both before and during the Scramble for Antarctica, and has no plans to stop until Chile's rightful Antarctic territory is restored."
 
 AAO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Formed from the Australian, New Zealand, and former French claims during the Scramble for Antarctica, the OFN Antarctic Administration controls nearly half of the world's southernmost continent. The massive swath of land acts as an important staging base for OFN operations in and around the Indian Ocean, with minor military installations and naval bases dotting the coast. With the completion of the nuclear power plant at McMurdo Station, it is clear that the OFN's presence on the continent will only continue to expand.\n\nHowever, much like the rest of the OFN, the Administration's direction has been thoroughly dominated by the will of the United States Military, something that Australia and New Zealand would like to see change in the near future."
 
 AAG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Third German Antarctic Expedition was, at the time, a secretive and minor event, conducting some token research and staking a vaguely defined claim in the middle of the Norwegian Antarctic zone. With the beginning of the Second World War, the claim and expedition were largely ignored, and slowly drifted into obscurity.\n\nAs the Scramble for Antarctica began, the Reich sifted through its old documents from the 1938 expedition, producing a defensible claim to the Neuschwabenland region. Reichskommissariat Norwegen relinquished its Antarctic claim to the Germans, who then consolidated the territory into the present administration. Calling on one of the few men left from the 1938 expedition, Rudolf Mayr was pulled from Südwestafrika, and given a position at the bottom of the world."
 
 AAJ_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In order to enforce their quickly written claim to Nobu Shirase Land (previously known as Marie Byrd Land) during the Scramble, the Japanese Empire dispatched a force of Teishin Shudan paratroopers under Rikichi Tsukada to secure control of their new land. The Japanese Antarctic Sector controls some of the most remote lands on the continent, but nonetheless, it has helped the Empire to further tighten its grip over the Pacific, and provide a gateway to South America.\n\nFollowing Tsukada's retirement, the territory is now home to the training facility for the 1st Airborne Brigade, under the command of Kinugasa Hayao. His small yet highly trained brigade is a powerful force on the continent, dedicated to maintaining, and possibly even expanding, should the opportunity arise, Japanese hegemony over the region."

 POLITICS_WILLIAM_RABORN_DESC:0 "Vice Admiral Raborn is a career military officer, spending his life shifting from post to post and up the military hierarchy. He slowly rose through the ranks starting as a gunner, then a naval aviator, then an instructor, he eventually found himself serving aboard the USS Hancock CV-19 performing well as an executive officer. His most significant accomplishment during this time was repairing the ships flight deck in under 4 hours after a kamikaze attack, allowing the carrier's aircraft to return safely. Unlike most of the American Pacific Fleet, the Hancock was not destroyed at Iwo Jima, staying close enough to Luzon that she could escape the fate of her sister ships.\n\nAfter nearly being blinded by Pearl Harbor's destruction, Raborn was given several large management roles in the Pacific Fleet's air command, eventually commanding the USS Bairoko CVE-115, where he once more witnessed a nuclear blast as Castle Bravo detonated over Signy Island in the South Atlantic. After moving to a few more instructor posts, Raborn was appointed Director of Special Projects for the Navy Department, where he managed the design of the UGM-27 Polaris. While he had little experience in engineering and science, his managerial skills and effective utilization of PERT (Project Evaluation and Review Technique) methodology got the job done 4 years ahead of schedule. This great success got him promoted to Vice Admiral in 1960, and then appointed as the Chief of the Antarctic Development Command and the OFN Antarctic Administration in 1961.\n\nAntarctica is cruel to strangers, and Raborn is foreign in more ways than one. After a year stationed in Antarctica, he has found that his duties have little to do with project management. Every day he is awoken with reports of Kenpeitai spies, German infiltration, and worst of all the complaints from OFN allies and politicians back home, neither of whom seem poised to make his job any easier."

Indeed it was these connections that catapulted Beal into his new role. Using his newfound influence, Beale seeks to bring a bureaucrat's graceful touch to Antarctica, rationalizing the barely ordered chaos of the OAA.\n\nAlready Beale has set to work rationalizing the supply chains and increasing their reliance on the miracle of nuclear power all while bringing in reliable and hardy Australians to man new posts. This commitment to efficiency and personable attitude has allowed him to maintain relations with the Americans.

Inspired by their neighbors in Argentina, Hillary has set to work preparing a Polar expedition to surpass even the heights of Everest.

Born in Rancagua in 1903, Escudero led a normal life, working as a professor at the University of Chile in the 1930s and 1940s. By all accounts, he led a regular life of obscurity. This changed when Escudero put forward studies that provided a legal basis for Chile's claims to Antarctic land. The studies mentioned the Treaty of Tordesillas and the Chilean inheritance of Castilian claims. Escudero further noted that Emperor Charles V granted a Spanish merchant, Pero Sancho de la Hoz, governing power of "all land south of the Strait of Magellan". His paper was published in 1941, and Chile got to work establishing legitimacy to the claim quickly. The paper that Escudero published also noted the legitimacy of Argentine claims in Antarctica, considering that Argentina also inherited claims from Spain. Unfortunately for Escudero, this gesture of diplomatic good-will would bite him spectacularly later. Despite his wishes to see the entire Antarctic Peninsula fall under Chilean control as "O'Higgins Land" and for Chile to own all of Ellsworth Land, he would find his country vastly outmaneuvered at the negotiating table. Ironically, some of his own studies were used to give legitimacy to Argentina rather than Chile.\n\nFrustrated with the failure of his country to press the claims he had given them, Escudero petitioned the Chilean government to give him a more direct role in future negotiations regarding the Antarctic. To his surprise, they not only agreed to his request, but further offered him the opportunity to manage the Antarctic territory directly. Escudero accepted the position, seeing it as the best way to directly ensure his country takes advantage of what they can with their small territory. Currently, Escudero is overseeing construction operations and minor military bases in the Chilean Antarctic. In proving the usefulness of the territory, he hopes that the population of his country will become more invested in seeing it not only become developed, but expanded. His policy is that of calm diplomacy; Rather than reckless displays of force, he hopes to outmaneuver his foes with wit and words. To this end, he has maintained a comfortably low profile. Of course, should misfortune fall upon his neighbors in Japanese Antarctic Sector and Argentine Antarctica, he would be more than happy to use it to Chile's advantage."

His first foray into polar expeditions was in 1938, when he flew for Lauge Koch's expedition to Northern Greenland. Thanks to his newly acquired experience in polar climates, he was chosen to fly the Dornier Wal 'Passat' on Alfred Ritscher's 1939 Antarctic Expedition. It was here that he first met Richardheinrich Schirmacher, who flew the 'Boreas', and obtained his first experiences flying over the world's southernmost continent. Unfortunately, further expeditions in the world's polar regions were put on hold with the outbreak of the Second World War, and Mayr was called to serve the Reich as a member of Kampfgeschwader 40. Once again, Mayr was flying over the Atlantic, although this time he was bombing enemy ships rather than ferrying passengers.\n\nAs the war came to a close, and Germany's victory was secured, Mayr was assigned to Südwestafrika, assisting Oberst Schenck with managing the day to day operations of the Reichskommissariat, and putting his connections inside Lufthansa to good use. As he worked in Africa, Antarctica was partitioned and divided up amongst the powers of the world during the Scramble for Antarctica, creating the German territory of Neuschwabenland. While the West Russian War and the subsequent supply shortage put an end to Germany's plan to colonize their Antarctic territory, the war did not spell the end for the ice sheets of Neuschwabenland. The Reich required a new administrator for the region, preferably one with experience this time. They called upon Luftwaffe Oberstleutnant and SS-Sturmbannführer Rudolf Mayr, who had experienced Antarctica all those years ago on the 1939 Expedition. Now, pulled from Südwestafrika and once again operating on the world's southernmost continent, Mayr is tasked with managing his commitments to the Reich and keeping the men under his command alive. Unfortunately for him, the CIA, Kenpeitai, Schumann's excessive plans, and the continent itself do not intend to make it easy for him."

 POLITICS_JULIO_MUSSO_DESC: "A longtime Antarctic enthusiast, Julio César Musso has followed a somewhat straight trajectory to the shores of the Exiled Continent. During the early '50s, he edited publications concerning a possible Uruguayan claim to Antarctica using the theory of Polar Frontage. He was an ardent supporter of the Uruguayan exploratory mission to the continent in 1954, and was outraged by the German seizure of his nation's claimed territory.\n\nIn 1956, following the Uruguayan Grey Scare, and the increased focus on Antarctica by Chile and Argentina, Musso began working with his compatriot Captain Carlos Travieso Fernández to form the Uruguayan Commission for Antarctic Cooperation. Musso oversaw the transformation of this private amateur organization into the more professional Uruguayan Antarctic Institute throughout the following years. The Explosion of the Snipe War across the Antarctic in 1958 led to the Ministry of Defence absorbing the UAI in 1961, drastically expanding its funding and capabilities.\n\nThe Antarctic claim of Uruguay, however, languished under Nazi-controlled Neuschwabenland, with Uruguay unable to assert its legal and just claims-until Operation Southern Cross, that is. Brazilian and Uruguayan troops have seized the Western fringe of the German Antarctic during their darkest hour, encountering scant resistance. Cooperation with the American-dominated OFN has been somewhat uncomfortable for Musso, but strange times-and these are strange times-make stranger bedfellows still. Musso is aware that the clock is running out. Germany will return to the continent in force. It's only a matter of when."

This spearpoint must be sharp, it must cut through surfaces like a hot knife through fat, and it must, above all else, be unyielding. The Argentine Republic, its eyes turned to the far reaches of the South, has chosen Jorge Edgar Leal to be its spearpoint - and he is determined to thrust into the very floor of the world itself.\n\nColonel Leal, born from unassuming origins in the province of Salta, rose rapidly through his military career. His entry to the Argentine Military Academy in 1939 propelled him further, to a series of command posts in the rank of Second Lieutenant, then to Captain and finally to San Martín Military Base itself in 1951. Here, in the shadow of the great whiteness, Jorge would fall in love with the barren beauty of the continent, and it was to this wilderness that he would return over the course of the next decade.\n\nIn this, he has been aided by the zeal of the Argentine Government to which he answers - his predecessor, General Pujato, founded the rickety network of seaplanes and bases upon which Leal's network in Antarctica functions, and the Argentine government itself hungers for foreign victories upon the wilderness to its deep south. The lurking threat of the Yanquis, the Japanese and the Germans have funneled extraordinary levels of funding to Leal's mandate in the wastes, and with it comes the expectation that Leal will guard what a generation of explorers have struggled to build.\n\nBut even this surge of funding is not enough for Leal, for his administration harbors not just warplanes and dossiers in its ambitions. The Colonel's Operación 90, a plan to push the boundaries of Argentine Antarctic claims towards the glimmering Pole at their apex, is taking shape in the middle of the storm. It is a plan that will bring eternal glory to the Argentine people, heap shame upon regional rivals, and cement Leal's place in the annals of history.\n\nThe spearpoint of Argentina, the explorer-colonel, chafes at the bit, ready to bring his country to greatness. Only one question remains. Is the Colonel ready to conquer the tip of the world - and how long must he wait to strike?"

Is this punishment for some unknown failure, a sign of lost favor in the byzantine labyrinths of the Italian government, or is the man simply an enthusiast of all things Antarctic?\n\nTorrisi's appointment grows less odd and more ominous when one peers beneath the surface. Take his membership in the secretive international Catholic organization Communion and Liberation, a group rumored to be involved in plots and conspiracies around the globe. Or consider his shadowy meetings with Captain Emilio Massera, the volatile and enigmatic Argentine Antarctic naval commander and fellow member of Communion and Liberation.

In June of 1958, the Argentine Navy unilaterally invaded and seized the disputed western portion of their Antarctic claim, as well as several smaller islands in the Beagle Channel, though the Chilean response managed to repel and push back further Argentine expansion.\n\nDespite the Argentinean government officially denying their involvement in the incident, OFN mediators withdrew from negotiations between the two South American countries, leaving Argentina to deal with her ill-gotten gains.

Should our foes make their move, they will quickly learn that our claims aren't backed by paperwork alone."

 AAV_Legal_Infallibility: "Legal Infallibility"
 AAV_Legal_Infallibility_desc: "As the Scramble for Antarctica accelerated, the OFN encouraged the Oriental Republic to lay claim to parts of what was formerly Queen Maud Land, within German Neuschwabenland. The claim was justified using the theory of Polar Frontage.\n\nIn 1954, a small Uruguayan Expedition planted a flag on the coast, conducted cartography, and assessed the theoretical prospect of oil and mineral deposits. Within weeks of their departure, the Germans swept through the area, establishing a permanent presence, to the despair of Uruguay's burgeoning Antarctic community. Uruguay has a legal right to these lands, no matter what the great powers may say."
 AAV_Skeleton_Crew: "Skeleton Crew"
 AAV_Skeleton_Crew_desc: "The Uruguayans in Antarctica know they're in a precarious position. Uruguay enthusiastically joined the OFN-led Operation Southern Cross to de-Nazify the continent. The western thrust of this operation easily seized the mostly empty Ritscher Land, its garrisons seemingly withdrawn to Schirmacher Base due to logistics issues.\n\nNow, with the cessation of Southern Cross in the face of stiffening resistance, Uruguayan Antarctica has been left sandwiched between New Swabia and a Brazilian claim more concerned with the perfidious Argentine farther west. Uruguay has the weakest military presence on the continent. When the Nazis return, it is the Uruguayan who will see them coming first. Our thoughts are with the boys in the field. They will need all the help they can get."
 AAV_The_Creeping_Dark: "The Creeping Dark"
 AAV_The_Creeping_Dark_desc: "The participation of Brazil and Uruguay in Operation Southern Cross was conceived as an independent effort, without direct participation from America or other members of the OFN. Despite the initial lack of resistance, all parties are cognizant that a German return to the continent is imminent.\n\nProfessor Musso and Captain Treviso are reluctant to allow a buildup of OFN men and materiel, the hope being that, in their absence, the Nazis will look east towards Hitlerland. However, fear is an effective motivator, and as the darkness of the Antarctic night approaches, and the Wehrmacht closes in, minds may be changed."

 AAR_Misplacement_to_Correct: "A Misplacement to Correct"
 AAR_Misplacement_to_Correct_desc: "The flag of Order and Progress flies on the ice as one of many banners in an international denazification mission. But the offensive against world Fascism has led Brazil's soldiers to the wrong landing spot, in a part of Uruguay's slice of the pie. According to polar frontage theory, Brazil's true, legitimate claim lies to the west: occupied by the Argentines.\n\nThough they're still finding their footing, Brasília is intent on expelling the foreigners that seized its rightful territory. Brazilian Antarctica's future is fraught with inevitable conflict as the most inhospitable front of the South American Cold War."
 AAR_Borrowed_Time: "On Borrowed Time"
 AAR_Borrowed_Time_desc: "Boasting the strongest military muscle in South America, Brazil continues the legacy of joint operations with the Allies, now the OFN, that began during the war. Cutting-edge jets and imposing warships herald a triumphant entrance onto the Antarctic stage. However, as the first boots storm ashore, the frigid reality is setting in.\n\nWarm clothing shortages. Outdated, insufficient snowcats. Habitats unreliable for polar conditions. South America's premier soldiers are wholly unequipped for Antarctica. They huddle for precious warmth, watching the days shorten, and hope that the spirit of wartime cooperation means sorely needed OFN support is on its way - before the long night descends..."
 AAR_Task_Force_Antarctica: "Task Force Antártica"
 AAR_Task_Force_Antarctica_desc: "Brazil's incursion into the frozen continent would not be possible without the valiant Task Force Antártica bridging the gap. Hardened by the Lobster War, they plunge fearlessly into the dark waters of the Southern Ocean. And how could they fear, with the Brazilian Navy's flagship, the modern aircraft carrier Minas Gerais, at the helm?\n\nStill, their steel glistens fainter day by day in the receding sunlight. Helicopters from Minas Gerais ferrying vital supplies to the marines ashore find their turnarounds longer and longer. Spreading pack ice pushes the Task Force away from the coast. The ice, not the Kriegsmarine, is their deadliest foe. The window is closing."

Its garrison, the administrators of the Italian Empire's most far-flung possession, pass their days under near-constant rainfall. Here, supply shipments are few and far between, and the only communication with the homeland must go through Italian envoys in Buenos Aires.\n\nRome's sons hunker down to defend their miserable little corner of the map. As to whether they are able to hold these lands because of Fascism's indomitable will or because their boots simply froze to the ground, not even the Italians could say."
 AAI_Kingmaker: "Kingmaker"
 AAI_Kingmaker_desc: "Despite their less-than-desirable location, the Italians have the potential to play a critical role in the coming power plays on the continent.\n\nThe Argentine Antarctic Institute and its rival, the Argentine Navy vie for the Italians' patronage in hopes it will secure their future. Meanwhile, the strategic location of Galindez Island between Chilean and Argentine bases could allow the Italians to determine the fate of any future naval campaigns in the region.\n\nIn conflicts both within and without, Italy's decisive influence positions them well for the future, despite the current state of their miserable little base. After all, it's good to be king, but sometimes it's better to be kingmaker."
 AAI_Hooks_Harpoons: "Hooks and Harpoons"
 AAI_Hooks_Harpoons_desc: "For a so-called Research Zone, shockingly little actual scientific inquiry is performed on Galindez Island, with one notable exception. Eager to plug the drain of capital disappearing into their isolated outpost, the Italians have begun laying the groundwork for a vast new whaling enterprise mirroring the success of their Imperial compatriots in Japan.\n\nThese researchers hope to develop cutting-edge techniques to capture and refine whale products as cheaply and efficiently as possible. Potential locations for processing facilities and harbors are being assessed to find the most profitable way to butcher the many species of whale found in the Southern Ocean. As yet another nation joins the hunt for these blubbery leviathans, the future of the whale grows bleaker still."

 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_7:0 "In the Antarctic interior, you only have what you bring with you. We will optimize our storage solutions to pack a greater volume of supplies into every nook and cranny of the snowcats and the sleds. This will increase Operación 90's margin of error."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_8:0 "Every drop of fuel is crucial to the expedition. Our snowcats are hungry beasts, gas guzzlers one and all, but by fine-tuning their engines, we can go farther with less. This might make the difference if we have to make any unplanned detours."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_9:0 "Antarctica is brutal to man and machine alike. The low temperatures and ice wreak havoc on the internal machinery of snowcats. Fuel lines freeze and pistons stick. If we want to make it to the pole and back, we need to increase engine reliability."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_10:0 "The snowcats' bogie wheels enable its locomotion. They're also an Achilles Heel, vulnerable to freezing and becoming jammed with ice. We need to outfit our snowcats with more durable tires and provide Operación 90 with antifreeze lubricants."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_11:0 "Byrd's polar expedition solidified the use of radio in Antarctic exploration. By modernizing our radios, we can increase their range and reliability. This will allow us to stay in closer contact for longer with Belgrano as we move further south."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_12:0 "The snowcats are designed to drive over rough terrain, but they've never been tested in the frigid Antarctic interior. Broken ground and sastrugi are ever-present hazards. Improving the vehicles' suspension will grant more flexibility of maneuver."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_13:0 "This continent is not a peaceful place. Many powers lay claim to its shores, and would be happy to see Operación 90 fail. They may interfere to make that happen, so we must prepare ourselves with rifles and ammo to deter any potential attack."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_14:0 "Operación 90 follows a very specific timetable, built around speed. We must get to the pole and back before anyone knows what we're up to. Ceppi's mechanics want to improve the snowcats through a series of tests, squeezing more speed out of them."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_15:0 "Should the secrecy of Operación 90 be compromised, it is possible one of the Antarctic powers might try to intercept us with a sizable force. In that event, General Pujato suggests mounting machine guns on the snowcats. Any enemy will think twice."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_16:0 "Following our test campaign of the snowcats' top speed, Ceppi and his mechanics have proposed a series of engine and gear modifications to raise the maximum velocity of our vehicles. Reaching the pole as fast as possible is eminently desirable."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_17:0 "There's no telling what threats might lurk in the interior. Our enemies are crafty. Therefore, extreme measures are required. High explosives will be added to the expedition's arsenal. Who knows? It might also allow for some creative problem solving."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_18:0 "Ceppi and his mechanics have worked wonders with the snowcat engines, but they believe there is still more performance we can eke out of the machines. Given a bit more time, they can make it so that the snowcats fly across the ice in style. Huzzah!"
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_19:0 "Dogs form a key support role in Operación 90. We've just had some more huskies delivered from Pakt-aligned Norway and Sweden, and it's time to get the men used to working with the new animals, and vice versa. We'll host a series of obstacle courses."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_20:0 "The most basic instrument of Antarctic traversal is the ski. They carry us across the snow and help us conserve energy. If all else is lost, our skis will be our only hope, and therefore we need the highest quality Scandinavian skis available."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_21:0 "The men are getting along well with the new dogs. They've become very comfortable with each other, and we can begin a new training regimen: a combination of endurance and obedience training will ensure they're ready for the journey. Who's a good dog?"
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_22:0 "The round trip to the pole will carry us a distance of nearly three thousand kilometres. We need to travel as light and as quickly as possible. By stripping the sleds and using the lightest possible materials, we'll lessen our burden considerably."
 Antarctica_GUI_AAA_Research_Window_Info_tech_info_tt_23:0 "The training of the huskies is paying off. They listen well to orders, and stay focused on their jobs. Now it's time to further develop pathfinding skills by conducting a series of long-range recon patrols into the Trinity Peninsula from Esperanza."

 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Admin_Icon_USA_tt:0 "The roots of the United States Antarctic Development Command trace back to the 1940 United States Antarctic Service Expedition, led by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd. The last expedition the US would undertake for some time, it established Little America III at the Bay of Whales. As the United States was not involved in any Antarctic matters until the Scramble, it did not have an organization in place for handling Antarctic affairs. Following the Scramble, and the creation of the OFN Antarctic Administration, Admiral Richard Byrd was placed in charge of the new United States Antarctic Development Command, which was created to handle all administrative and logistical matters for future American activities in the Antarctic.\n\nThe ADC works closely with other branches of the United States government, as well as the military, in order to ensure that all operations and functions proceed smoothly. The ADC also collaborates with the Australian Antarctic Division and the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme for matters related to running the OAA, and handles relations with foreign bodies such as the German DGfP and the International Committee for Antarctic Research. Historically, the OAA has always been led by the Chief of the ADC - first Admiral Byrd, then Admiral Anderson, and now Vice Admiral Raborn - but this may change in the future."
 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Admin_Icon_GER_tt:0 "The German Society for Polar Research, or the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Polarforschung (DGfP), was originally created by Alfred Ritscher as a non-governmental organization in the late 1940s to continue his work on the Antarctic, due to a lack of support for future research expeditions in the years following the Second World War. At its founding, it was called the Association for the Promotion of Polar Research, but was renamed following the Scramble for Antarctica when the organization was folded into the German government to manage future German efforts in Antarctica.\n\nThe DGfP saw some early success with the establishment of a permanent base at Schirmacher Oasis as well as several other outposts around Neuschwabenland. However, the West Russian War and the ensuing supply chain issues put an end to this string of successes, crippling the German colonization effort and forcing the DGfP to reevaluate Germany's position in Antarctica. Now, the German Antarctic region of Neuschwabenland is used as a weapons testing site by the Luftwaffe. They maintain Erprobungsstelle Neuschwabenland, which the DGfP deals with administrative matters, supply shipments, and cooperative efforts with other branches of the military and outside organizations."
 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Admin_Icon_JAP_tt:0 "Legally speaking, Japan's claim to the Antarctic is complete nonsense. They know it, their enemies know it, and yet the Rising Sun is determined to maintain its grip on what they claim is their portion of the southern continent. As such, the Japanese Antarctic Sector is entirely managed by the IJA, and watched over by the elite 1st Airborne Brigade. Back home, however, political matters pertaining to Antarctica are handled by the Japanese Antarctic Management Bureau. Formed about a year after the Scramble, it was created in response to increasing protests from the OFN regarding the supposed illegal occupation of Marie Byrd Land. The Bureau works closely with the IJA in order to coordinate diplomatic matters and to keep tensions at a minimum when possible. The main goal of the JAMB, however, it to prevent the Americans and the Germans from forcing the Japanese off the continent by solely diplomatic means. Japan may control the most powerful force in Antarctica, but a chain is only as strong as its weakest link."

One of the most important tasks we have is assigning a budget for our territory, as greater investment will likely result in greater success and longevity for our administration."

He slowly rose through the ranks starting as a gunner, then a naval aviator, then an instructor, he eventually found himself serving aboard the USS Hancock CV-19 performing well as an executive officer. His most significant accomplishment during this time was repairing the ships flight deck in under 4 hours after a kamikaze attack, allowing the carrier's aircraft to return safely. Unlike most of the American Pacific Fleet, the Hancock was not destroyed at Iwo Jima, staying close enough to Luzon that she could escape the fate of her sister ships.\n\nAfter nearly being blinded by Pearl Harbor's destruction, Raborn was given several large management roles in the Pacific Fleet's air command, eventually commanding the USS Bairoko CVE-115, where he once more witnessed a nuclear blast as Castle Bravo detonated over Signy Island in the South Atlantic. After moving to a few more instructor posts, Raborn was appointed Director of Special Projects for the Navy Department, where he managed the design of the UGM-27 Polaris. While he had little experience in engineering and science, his managerial skills and effective utilization of PERT (Project Evaluation and Review Technique) methodology got the job done 4 years ahead of schedule. This great success got him promoted to Vice Admiral in 1960, and then appointed as the Chief of the Antarctic Development Command and the OFN Antarctic Administration in 1961.\n\nAntarctica is cruel to strangers, and Raborn is foreign in more ways than one. After a year stationed in Antarctica, he has found that his duties have little to do with project management. Every day he is awoken with reports of Kenpeitai spies, German infiltration, and worst of all the complaints from OFN allies and politicians back home, neither of whom poised seem to make his job any easier."

 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Leader_GER1_tt:0 "There is much to be said about the life of Alfred Ritscher. A career sailor, he captained the boat that carried Herbert Schröder-Stranz on the German Arctic Expedition in 1912. During the first World War, he was a reconnaissance pilot over Belgium, and later became an aerial navigator for Lufthansa. By 1934, Ritscher had made a career with the German War Department, and became an officer in the Navy as well. In order to preserve his career during the rise of the Nazis, Ritscher divorced his Jewish wife, and remarried.\n\n1938 was the year of the now infamous Third German Antarctic Expedition. At the time, it was a quiet and secretive affair, as Ritscher led his team to search for a location for a German whaling station in the Antarctic. A follow-up expedition was planned, but the outbreak of the Second World War put any future plans on hold. Even after Germany's triumph, there was little interest in pursuing further Antarctic endeavors. As such, Ritscher founded the Association for the Promotion of Polar Research in order to continue his work. However, the outbreak of the Scramble for Antarctica in the early 1950s saw him become unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight. The Third German Antarctic Expedition was now the backbone of the German claim to Antarctica.\n\nCalled upon by the German government to return to Antarctica, Ritscher was given command of a Kriegsmarine task force and an array of support staff in order to establish a German base on the southern continent. This base would grow to become Schirmacher Station. At the same time, American Rear Admiral Richard Byrd was dispatched by the USA for a similar task, and Ritscher was now locked into conflict with his former colleague as the Cold War took Antarctica by storm. Ritscher's Association was renamed to the German Society for Polar Research, or the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Polarforschung, and placed in charge of administering the new Antarctic territory. Now, at 83 years old, Alfred Ritscher continues to lead the DGfP, providing whatever aid he can to the struggling German territory of Neuschwabenland."
 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Leader_GER2_tt:0 "Much like his late predecessor, Karl-Heinz Röbke is also a veteran of the Third German Antarctic Expedition. However, his reasons for accompanying the expedition couldn't have been any more different. A staunch NSDAP conservative, Röbke was in charge of ensuring that the "political reliability" of the expedition members. Largely ignored during the expedition, Röbke had little success upon returning home as well, fading into the quagmire of NSDAP politics during the Second World War. He only managed to return to some notoriety after the Scramble for Antarctica, joining up with the DGfP to put his meager polar knowledge to use. Following the recent death of Alfred Ritscher, Röbke was placed in charge of the DGfP, almost entirely due to his presence on the Third Expedition. While he is quite happy about his promotion, the rising instability within the Reich may see his tenure cut short."
 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Leader_JAP_tt:0 "Iwao Fujita has never set foot upon Antarctica. Few rugged whalers of the frigid seas or fillers in rotten canneries have met the dual chairman of the Japan Whaling Association and the Greater Japan Fisheries Association, but from his corner of Tokyo's office space Fujita oversees their destiny. His signature, independent of Nissui or the IJN, is behind all logistics, shipments, and permits surrounding Japan's Antarctic venture. That independence is grounded in decades of experience as a corporate negotiator which resulted in a vast network of contacts inside the Sphere's companies, and the realm of politics. From his office, Fujita sees in Nissui's avarice an unsustainable spiral, recalling with quiet frustration the days of the war when the maritime industry's rival fleets were, if briefly, consolidated as a single body in service of one thing only: the Empire."

The New Zealand claim, known as the Ross Dependency, was placed under their control by the British in 1923, while the Australian claim was passed to them in 1933. The French claim was incorporated into the OAA during the Scramble for Antarctica by a United States decree, as the pro-German French government could not easily reach the claim or project power to dispute the annexation. On the other hand, the Free French government that originally claimed the region had little interest in protesting the action due to their situation at the time. Due to the combined size of these claims, we control just under half of the continent, bordered to the east by the Japanese Antarctic Sector, and to the west by New Swabia. "
 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Zone_GER_tt:0 "Neuschwabenland controls 20°W to 44°E, as well as Peter I Island. The basis for the German claim comes from the Third German Antarctic Expedition, which staked a vaguely defined claim within the Norwegian Antarctic region. This claim was formally passed to Germany by Reichskommissariat Norwegen during the Scramble for Antarctica, which, when combined with Germany's existing claim, gave them legitimate control over the region known as Queen Maud Land. The territory is now known as Neuschwabenland."
 Antarctica_GUI_Foreign_Zone_JAP_tt:0 "The Japanese Antarctic Sector controls 150°W to 90°W, the region formerly known as Marie Byrd Land. Prior to the Scramble, the region had not been formally claimed by any nation, making it the largest piece of unclaimed territory in the world at the time. Japan seized the territory by military force, and renamed to Nobu Shirase Land to strengthen their claim to the region. Although the region was unclaimed prior to their actions, neither the OFN or Germany seem interested in formally recognizing the claim."

 Antarctica_GUI_AAO_PERT_Info_button_tt:0 "§FThe §DProgram Evaluation and Review Technique§! is a project management tool developed by the §iUnited States Navy Special Projects Office§! for the §QPolaris Missile Development Program§!. It was used to great effect by §QVice Admiral Raborn§! during the development of §QPolaris§!, with the project being completed §Yfour years§! ahead of schedule. It is yet again time for the technique, and §QVice Admiral Raborn§!, to be put to the test in the field of §Knuclear§! missile development.\n\nThe main overview window displays the §YIntegrated Network§!, a diagram showing all of the interconnected PERT networks, as well as major §Bevents§! and §Oactivities§!. You can view the entire network using §Wclick-and-drag§!. §BEvents§! are represented as boxes, and §Oactivities§! are represented the arrows connecting them. Further details about the in-progress §Bevents§! and §Oactivities§! can be viewed by hovering over either. In the top right corner is the button to open the §QPERT§! decisions menu, giving you various options for interacting with the §QPERT§! §YNetwork§! you are currently viewing. The left side of the window shows the progress on the current missile design.\nClicking on any §Bevent§! in a different §YNetwork§! will open that network for closer analysis and decision making. There are four networks that will need to be completed before the project is finished: §BElectronics§!, §RAirframe§!, §GRe-Entry Vehicle§!, and §ITesting§!. Each §YNetwork§! has a different layout with different §Oactivities§! that need to be completed. It is recommended that you focus on prioritizing §Oactivities§! with the longest times, as cutting down these times will have the greatest impact in regards to shortening development time.\nActivies are considered completed when the §WExpected Completion Time§! reach zero. The §WExpected Completion Time§! is calculated with the following formula: (§GOptimistic Completion Time§!+§RPessimistic Completion Time§!+4*§BMost Likely Completion Time§!)/6, as determined by the §iUnited States Navy Special Projects Office§! in §Y1957§!.\n\nBeing §Oactively involved with the engineering process§!, without micromanaging, will be crucial in ensuring the success of the §QIceman Missile Development Project§!.§!"
