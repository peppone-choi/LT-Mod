 ### Ideas ###
 PAK_between_the_worlds: "Between the Worlds"
 PAK_between_the_worlds_desc: "Practically since the end of the British Raj the North-West Frontier Province has been violently split over what it is meant to be. Some call for Pashtunistan, others for Pakistan; there is also a significant pro-Indian bloc still asserting itself.\n\n"Brother rises against brother"; the different clans that form the ruling class of the NWFP are themselves divided over where to go from here. One will not find peace in schools or at watering holes, either: the intelligentsia is disunited and students fight among themselves. Discontent, fear, and uncertainty abound. While the Nawabzada and his administration themselves are pro-Afghan, the Pakistan Movement forces he relies upon are decidedly not."
 PAK_the_sandcastle: "The Sandcastle"
 PAK_the_sandcastle_desc: "The North-West Frontier Province's security situation is best likened to a collapsing sandcastle surrounded by violently squabbling children. Discontent, fear, hunger, and uncertainty are rife and the state is incapable or unwilling to act. One of the stand-out cases of this is inter-clan violence, a daily affair which the NWFP authorities are completely satisfied to leave alone.\n\nWorse yet for the NWFP is the fact of its reliance on the armed wing of a movement implacably hostile to it ideologically—the Muslim League National Guards. Beyond Peshawar and a network of loyal princely states in the far north, the state's writ has no effect. It is only exercised through allied clans or the openly disloyal MLNG, who seem able to tear down the sandcastle that is the Nawabzada's government permanently."
 PAK_pashtun_rule_british_policies: "Pashtun Rule; British Policies"
 PAK_pashtun_rule_british_policies_desc: "The North-West Frontier Province having become entirely self-administered does not mean that anything has really changed since the era of British colonial rule. Just like the Raj, the state relies on a network of maliks and other petty kings to administer the rural areas. Just like the Raj, the state is brutally disproportionate in exterminating anything it regards as a threat.\n\nOne of the most prominent victims of the brutish stability-maintenance policies of the Nawabzada's administration are the Khudai Khidmatgars, in English Servants of God. A nonviolent resistance movement dating back to the Raj, they are on the verge of destruction after thousands of them were slain by a joint death-squad operation executed by NWFP government forces and the MLNG."
 PAK_carrying_all_before_them: "Carrying All Before Them"
 PAK_carrying_all_before_them_desc: "Now is a time for the cauldrons of war to become red-hot with flame—now is the time for the Pakistan Movement to attain its success! The Pakistan Movement have knocked over the Nawabzada's pissant little kingdom and imposed their rule at gunpoint. Now the whole of the North-West Frontier Province must be reshaped in their image, refined in the flames of the forge, into a weapon pointing at their godless, communistic, pagan enemies across the Indus.\n\nThe days of Afghan rule are—for the moment—over. The NWFP is now beaten into shape under the direction of Abdul Qayyum Khan and his men. How much must be melted away, burned off like dross in a blacksmith's fire, before they regard themselves as ready?"
 PAK_one_flag_a_thousand_nations: "One Flag, a Thousand Nations"
 PAK_one_flag_a_thousand_nations_desc: "The Pakistani state is intensely stratified even by the standards of a world where social and ethnoreligious stratification is commonplace.\n\nAny notional guarantees of freedom of religion in Pakistan are trampled over by numerous legal and extralegal policies built solely to politically and economically disenfranchise non-Muslims. The Punjabi ethnicity sits unsteadily at the top of the Pakistani racial pyramid. It struggles to preserve its uneasy dominance over state affairs by discriminating against the other ethnicities that make up the state, who are themselves plagued by internal divides. Caste, officially denounced as a holdover of "Hindu paganism" and theoretically "nonexistent", in fact remains very important, with casteism permeating most political and social affairs."
 PAK_the_parliamentary_dictatorship: "The Parliamentary Dictatorship"
 PAK_the_parliamentary_dictatorship_desc: "The rotten boroughs of the pre-Reform Act United Kingdom have been admiringly copied by landowning rentier elites in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, who run the parliament and obtain the political changes they desire by forcing their tenants to vote for them. Pakistan is theoretically a democracy and de facto still a state with competitive elections, but the only people who can compete fairly are rival factions of landowners.\n\nA majority of mass parties are banned the moment they attempt to participate in elections. The Pakistani National Assembly is therefore constitutionally incapable of truly representing the popular will. The Prime Minister is accountable—but only to Parliament, not the people, making Pakistan a dictatorship of parliamentarians and an oligarchy in the truest possible sense of the word."
 PAK_an_administrative_chimera: "An Administrative Chimera"
 PAK_an_administrative_chimera_desc: "The newborn nation of Pakistan is predicated on incoherent and self-contradicting legal principles. No constitution exists, while the laws are mere remnants of the Raj. The nation is de jure a dominion of the United Kingdom for the sake of claiming that they were made independent in 1945 and not 1965, but it also routinely claims ideological allegiance to Islamic principles and sharia law.\n\nIn reality, neither British common law nor the commands of Allah and the Prophet hold the allegiance of the Government of Pakistan. Real power is in the hands of the Chief Martial Law Administrator and those that support him. No hadith or legality has the sort of sway that simple brute force does in the Pakistan of today."
 PAK_the_scrap_of_paper: "The Scrap of Paper"
 PAK_the_scrap_of_paper_desc: "The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan makes any amount of promises. It guarantees freedom of speech, multiparty democracy, and equality of peoples as the foundation of a truly Islamic government adherent to the commands of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. But the people that wrote these principles—the founding fathers of Pakistan—put about as much value on them as they do the paper they were written on.\n\nA sheaf of papers like the Pakistani Constitution is useless to learn the real ruling principles of the nascent Islamic Republic, laid out faithfully by Abdul Qayyum Khan and followed assiduously by his loyal successors. The answer is found by looking away from one's desk towards the ground, contemplating the tens of thousands of clandestine graves of victims known and unknown dug from Peshawar to Karachi—and the many more burials certain to follow."
 PAK_the_fires_must_burn: "The Fires Must Burn"
 PAK_the_fires_must_burn_desc: "Pakistan is beginning to enter an industrial age that rivals any of their competitors as glossy pamphlets exhorting the greatness of “Das Pakistanisch-Modell” can be found in Frankfurt's financial hubs. European capital flocks to Karachi and Lahore, hoping to carve off a slice for themselves in a frenzied marketplace akin to a slaughterhouse.\n\nThe actual slaughterhouse exists in the factories and workshops that make up the meat of this newfound boom. Industrial regulation exists on paper but nowhere else. Child labor devours the futures of the urban and rural poor, enslaved by eternal debt and brutalized by uncaring overseers. They are but kindling for the fires of industry, and to Pakistan's upper class, one thing is certain: growth must never stop, no matter the human cost."
 PAK_networks_upon_networks: "Networks Upon Networks"
 PAK_networks_upon_networks_desc: "There is no governance in Pakistan that does not avail itself of, or become dominated by, the networks upon networks of patronage and "mutual benefit" created by the Muslim League National Guards in their pursuit of Pakistan.\n\nThe vast majority of state business is only handled if the MLNG is somehow used as an intermediary. The court system is nonfunctional, and all justice is done summarily. As if deliberately imitating the age-old words "If they must have a tax collector, they might just as well have a thug," the MLNG has also arrogated revenue collection to itself.\n\nDrastic action must be taken to send the MLNG back to the barracks. Otherwise, the military may find itself critically overstretched at a time when other state institutions run the risk of being alienated from the Government."
 PAK_an_army_of_patronage: "An Army of Patronage"
 PAK_an_army_of_patronage_desc: "The Islamic Republic of Pakistan has two military forces. There is the professional and merit-based Pakistan Army, which is the smaller of the two. Then there are the larger, patronage-based Pakistan Levies, a descendant organization of the Muslim League National Guards raised on a regional basis and functioning autonomously.\n\nCommand of a section of the Levies is usually determined by appointing regional notables to it. That process of appointment, though the simplest one available, is also eye-wateringly corrupt: allies and relatives are appointed to subordinate positions, and officerial rank is simply bought and sold. The Levies are thus of at best disputed utility as a military force, but are preeminently useful as a tool of patronage."
 PAK_power_vacuum: "Power Vacuum"
 PAK_power_vacuum_desc: "When a government disappears, a power vacuum takes hold. Case in point: Pakistan after the evacuation of its government by the German Reich.\n\nThe Muslim League National Guard remnants have no idea who they are meant to obey, with no clear leader of the nation. Desertion is, accordingly, rife. The Pakistan Army is trying to reimpose order on the streets of the nation at a time where common sense would demand they instead be present on the border with India. Rural uprisings have begun across the nation, and what is left of the government is powerless to do anything about it. The last nail in the coffin: the police, hoping to be spared by the Azad Hind Fauj after it crosses the border, have declared total neutrality."

 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_NAWABZADA_SHAHABUDDIN_KHAN_DESC: "Nawabzada Shahabuddin Khan, Khan of Jandol and Nawab of Dir, second son of Nawab Shah Jehan Khan, is a harsh, ruthless man with a strong devotion to duty.\n\nThat is appropriate given his second job as the Afghan-appointed military governor of the frontier provinces, set up by the Khanate of Afghanistan in opposition to the remnants of the Pakistan Army on the frontier. His duty is to make sure the Pakistani Army remains on the frontier and does not backfire on Afghanistan; being a loyal subordinate of Afghanistan, he takes to this duty with alacrity.\n\nWhen Shahabuddin Khan is not keeping a lid on the Pakistanis, he is governing his pair of small princely states in the northwest of what was supposed to have Pakistan. Many praise him for his efforts to modernize his state - he single-handedly funds schools, hospitals, fortifications and roads all over his domain. But just as many people criticize him for the ruthlessness he exhibits in his dealings with anyone he meets.\n\nHis absolute rule over the region ruins just as many lives as it uplifts; countless tribal groups hold him as their enemy for his incessant expropriations of tribal land for the purposes of development. The civilians in the Frontier Provinces outside of the Pakistani frontier or Jandol and Dir are not too impressed with him either; his absolutist, ruthless rule causes no small number of them to chafe under him, and there are rumblings of pro-Pakistani and even pro-Indian sentiment.\n\nFaced with all these things, the Nawabzada will do as he always has: assert his authority and suppress dissent until it calms down. It has worked before - why should it not work again?"
 POLITICS_ABDUL_QAYYUM_KHAN_DESC: "Abdul Qayyum Khan, above all else, is a man of blood.\n\nOnce he was a supporter of the INC-aligned Khudai Khidmatgars, but in the late 1940s he turned coat to the All-India Muslim League. He proved his loyalty to the cause by slaughtering his former party's supporters. Elected the leader of the AIML by 1959, today Khan sits as the primary Pashtun leader of the AIML.\n\nKhan's might is most powerfully felt wherever the Muslim League National Guards, a paramilitary loyal to his person alone, hold their strongest sway. But that fact damages his reputation amidst the landowners that support the AIML, who do not appreciate the singular loyalty the MLNG shows. It also further damages him with the two professional formations of the Pakistan Movement, the Jammu and Kashmir Regiment and the Frontier Force, who both regard the MLNG as undisciplined louts and a liability to the Movement.\n\nFor now, however, Abdul Qayyum Khan sits securely. The AIML knows well that a man of his nature is exactly what is needed to see the dream of a Pakistan established from Kashmir to Balochistan made into reality."
 POLITICS_FEROZ_KHAN_NOON_DESC: "How powerful an irony it is that Feroz Khan Noon was chosen to lead Pakistan out of its infancy—a man that never wanted to see Pakistan be born in the first place! Search the man's mind and you will have no trouble finding where his real loyalties have lain all these years. Feroz Khan Noon has only ever been truly loyal to Britain, where he spent his happiest years. He supported India remaining under British rule until the bitter end.\n\nTime passed. In 1965, the Star and Crescent began to fly over more and more towns in Punjab. Noon saw the changes in the winds and realised the benefit they could have for him and contacted his old friends in the All-India Muslim League.\n\nThe soldiers of the Movement reached Feroz Khan Noon's village, Nurpur Noon, with the flag in hand and ready to plant it, only to see it planted from every vantage point in the settlement. No man was more enthusiastic for the task of recruiting ex-unionists into the PML once the war ended than Feroz Khan Noon. No man was happier than him when that mobilization proved useful to throw Qayyum Khan out during the Constitutional Convention, leaving him in charge.\n\nMake no mistake, Feroz Khan Noon will run Pakistan to the best of his ability. He will see to it that the Islamic Republic is shaped for the only legitimate purpose which he could ever conceive of: to protect and serve the elite class from which he originates."
 POLITICS_MUMTAZ_DAULTANA_DESC: "Mumtaz Daultana supported the idea of Pakistan early on, having joined the All India Muslim League in 1942. The ban on the AIML was no obstacle. Though Daultana joined the Unionists, he kept in touch with his former comrades and maintained such an extensive network that he became the underground commander of the Multan Division of the MLNG well before 1965.\n\nTo Mumtaz Daultana's mind, it should thus have stood to reason that he would assume the position of Prime Minister once the war had finished. It was much to his disgust that Daultana found that Feroz Khan Noon—his old family rival—had gained Punjabi aristocratic backing before Daultana could persuade the former Unionists to get behind him.\n\nBut all things come to an end. Feroz Khan Noon fell, and the aristocrats fell in behind Mumtaz Daultana. It was not just them, either. The clerical parties have all thrown their backing behind the new Daultana administration. If Mumtaz Daultana can survive the backlash from the firestorm that the clerics wish to unleash on the religious minorities of Pakistan, they may yet be able to raise him to an even higher dignity than that of Prime Minister."
 POLITICS_MAHMUD_AHMED_DESC: "Mahmud Ahmed was not born a terrorist. He was born a Muslim in Ludhiana, during the first days of the Republic of India. His childhood was hardly noteworthy, and no different from that of a typical Muslim child in India. However, nobody is born a villain - or, if you ask the disturbingly large number of Ahmed's supporters, a hero.\n\nNobody has a unified consensus on where Ahmed learned of the methods of terrorism and other ideas in the name of national liberation. According to some, he took inspiration from the INA's tactics in the Indian War of Independence. According to himself, he was, as a young boy, gifted an ayah by Allah himself, who told him of the necessity for a Jihad against the Hindu. He avoided conscription so that he would not serve the Hindu, and fled to the mountains across the loose border. It was here that he disappeared into the mountains, and received further ayahs from the Greatest.\n\nIt has now been years since he disappeared, and Ahmed has returned to free his people. Fighting alongside his numerous followers, he is known as al-Azad, or "the Free" in Urdu. His plan is to oust the Hindu from the Land of the Pure at any cost, and to build a new Islamic state on the ashes of what will be burnt down. After years, centuries of oppression, the time has come for all Muslims of India to break the chains that bind them, in the name of Faith, Unity, and Discipline. And just as those great warriors of Islam fought against the Crusaders, Ahmed and the new Mujahideen fight against the Hindu infidels for the glory of Allah."
 POLITICS_INTERNAL_COMMOTION_OF_THE_STATE_DESC: "Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has shown its incompetence in the face of the needs of its people;\n\nWhereas, thanks to its failure, internal commotion has taken hold across all regions of the Republic, with the Army overextended, the Pakistan Levies absent without leave, and rural uprisings rife;\n\nWhereas the Government of the German Reich, having tried and failed to use the people of the lands claimed by Pakistan for its own benefit, has evacuated only those who were useful to it, leaving the remainder of the people in the region in dire straits;\n\nWhereas, thanks to these demonic machinations of the two Governments, there is functionally no authority anywhere in the region formerly referred to as Pakistan, a situation which cannot be borne nor permitted to continue;\n\nTHEREFORE, we, civilian, police, and military petitioners concerned for the welfare of the North-West Frontier Provinces, West Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, and other territories occupied by the disappeared government, and assuring the President of Azad Hind of our full support for the needs of the Azad Hind Fauj in our territories as they restore order, humbly petition the Executive and Legislative Powers of the Republic of Azad Hind to assume immediate responsibility for the former Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\n(Signed) Emergency Convocation, Rawalpindi"
 POLITICS_ZULFIKAR_ALI_BHUTTO_DESC: "When in Larkana of Sindh the sun rose on Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto for the first time in 1928, his whole family knew he was always fated for greatness.\n\nHis father, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, one of the largest landowners of Sindh and later to become its Chief Minister, sponsored his political career from the outset. The creation of Pakistan did seem a bit of a setback to him at first, what with his father having led the unionist forces in Sindh. But that fear gave way to reality: the birth of Pakistan granted Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto more power than he could ever have had in India.\n\nThe problem is that that opportunity has come at a time of chaos. Today, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto sits at the head of a highly unstable regionalist coalition. That coalition was brought about by Sindhi resentment against Punjabi dominance and Pashtun regions' rage at the brutality and treachery of the state during the Frontier Emergency.\n\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto's family always knew he was destined for greatness. But they did not know how long that was for. If Bhutto fails to stabilise his governing coalition around himself, his term as Prime Minister may be far shorter than he wants."
 POLITICS_JAHANARA_SHAHNAWAZ_DESC: "Jahanara Shahnawaz is one of the few "elders" or old guards of the Muslim League left standing in the late 20th century.\n\nAs a leader in the AIML since the 1910s, she has had a long and illustrious political career in support of the creation of Pakistan—until the 1940s, when she was removed from all party positions due to her refusal to accept any boycott of British colonial institutions.\n\nQuickly joining the Unionists thereafter, she was elected to her family's provincial seat in the aftermath of the war and became a close associate and ally of Feroz Khan Noon. Some might make mocking comparisons to ducklings when observing Shahnawaz's trajectory, but Jahanara Shahnawaz in fact did follow right behind Noon when he rejoined her old party. She also served as Minister for Law and Justice in his government.\n\nWhen Feroz Khan Noon at last succumbed to illness in 1972, the PML was deadlocked on who to support as Prime Minister—in Noon's absence different factions emerged around different leaders. But Noon's widow, Minister of Foreign Affairs Viqar-un-Nisa Noon, threw her support behind Jahanara Shahnawaz, proving the deciding vote."

 PAK_Germany.1.t: "Unternehmen Menander Summary"
 PAK_Germany.1.desc: "TOP SECRET\nEYES ONLY\nTO ALL MEMBERS OF THE [getGermanIntelAgencyCaps]\nUNTERNEHMEN MENANDER\n\nPESHAWAR - NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE\n\nThe Pakistan movement is predicated upon a belief that Hindus and Muslims cannot live in a single state due to the history of oppression of Muslims by Hindus. It argues for the creation of Pakistan, "the land of the pure", in order to ensure the safety of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. Members of the Pakistan Movement tend to lionise European polities, such as our own, as manifestations of superiority and martiality compared to the Hindu "pagans" to their east.\n\nRecently the Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan, Abdul Qayyum Khan, has reached out to us with the consent of the Pakistan Movement. A suitably ruthless man, he shares some of our views but more importantly understands—just as the rest of the Movement do—the reliability and superiority of the German state as a partner and ally for Pakistan. See Appendix B) pertaining to background information on Khan, and other data on the Pakistan Movement as provided by our local agents. Due for further research. End of page.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."
 PAK_Germany.1.a: "Our men in the subcontinent, huh?"

 PAK_Germany.2.t: "The Line Made Closer"
 PAK_Germany.2.desc: ""Well, then, Mr. Khan. You have done quite well for yourselves over in... Balochistan, wasn't it?" The foreign minister of the Reich nodded approvingly in the direction of his interlocutor, who had taken the seat usually reserved for guests of the Ambassador of Iran.\n\nAbdul Qayyum Khan smirked. "That we have, Foreign Minister. It didn't even take a whiff of grapeshot—we just came, saw, and conquered. Just like the Anschluss that the late Führer, may he rest in peace, pulled off so masterfully thirty years ago. I've been impressed ever since I first read about it."\n\nHaving nodded slightly at the memory of Hitler, the foreign minister looked back up with a gracious smile. "Yes, I can see the parallels. But even more importantly"—at this Khan almost perked up—"I can see a way forward now to ensure that the Pakistan Movement has no further struggles with supplying itself. We have a clear way to reach you now, Mr. Khan."\n\n"You mean—"\n\n"Yes, exactly that. The first proper shipments of weapons are already on their way. You'll find that the German Reich is very kind to its loyal allies."\n\nKhan bowed from his sitting position."
 PAK_Germany.2.a: ""And you, Minister, will not regret this generosity. I swear it.""

 PAK_Germany.3.t: "Unternehmen Menander Summary"
 PAK_Germany.3.desc: "TOP SECRET\nEYES ONLY\nTO ALL MEMBERS OF THE [getGermanIntelAgencyCaps]\nUNTERNEHMEN MENANDER\n\nPESHAWAR - NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE\n\nIn the last 72 hours [getGermanIntelAgency] operatives have noted (and Pakistani sources have confirmed) a significant offensive by Pakistani forces against Indian positions in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh. Though for the first few hours it seemed like the Indian positions might have broken or routed, they have since been reinforced, and pitched battles are now ongoing.\n\nThe Chief Martial Law Administrator, Abdul Qayyum Khan, has informed us that he is not entirely confident of success in the absence of continued German support. In accordance with our previous undertakings to him and to our ally of Pakistan generally, we must ensure that the Pakistani military is not starved of supplies in its struggle against the Indian government. End of page.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."
 PAK_Germany.3.a: "We had better seize this opportunity!"

 PAK_Germany.4.t: "From Middle to East"
 PAK_Germany.4.desc: "Ali looked out from the cruise liner. Volunteering to help defend fellow Muslims from oppression sure had its perks sometimes. Ali wasn't sure that this was what they'd envisioned in the Jamatkhana when they'd made the call, though: the German ship had excellent halal food, and the ship's crew had been impeccably polite.\n\nThe PA squawked. "Ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching Gwadar in the next few hours. Please retrieve your possessions and be ready for debarkation, keeping in mind that the departure will be rough."\n\nAli grabbed his kit, disembarked, and made his way to the nearest Pakistani flag. He stated his name and country of origin, was saluted and thanked for coming to the trouble of aiding Pakistan, then went in for basic training.\n\nThe basic training was challenging. The Pakistani drill sergeant, a veteran of the Muslim League National Guard, was exacting and ruthless. Sometimes the only relief they could expect was during the five prayer times. At least Ali was training among people from many other Muslim countries: Sunnis, fellow Shiites. There were even a few Germans working as ordinance officers and helping out with training.\n\nAli found himself on the front after about two weeks. Loading his rifle, he got ready and followed his squad out. He murmured the shahada to steady himself, then got to it."
 PAK_Germany.4.a: "Showtime."

 PAK_Germany.5.t: "From the Indus to the Rhine"
 PAK_Germany.5.desc: "Click. A channel changes. The television pans to the picture of the Foreign Minister of the Reich just after his name is mentioned.\n\nAnother change in camera angle, and a representative from Denmark. Another from another country, yet another from yet another country, then—\n\n"—the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, who has arrived at the Permanent Council for the first time today. With the Minister's presence, ladies and gentlemen, the accession of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to both the Einheitspakt and the European Economic Community is formalized."\n\nThe Pakistani envoy stands up and receives the applause of the assembled delegates, then begins a prepared speech in German. Praising the achievements of the German state in support of culture and stability in Europe, the Minister pledges the support of Pakistan for its fellow members of the Pakt and EEC.\n\nA standing ovation. Meanwhile, the man watching the TV nods appraisingly and leaves."
 PAK_Germany.5.a: "They are all of one kind."

 PAK_Germany.6.t: "Double, Double"
 PAK_Germany.6.desc: ""Alright then, Minister. The Government wanted me to discuss the possibility of further economic integration of Pakistan into the European Economic Community, with a particular emphasis on the German economic sphere."\n\nPakistan's foreign minister looked at the Reich Minister of Finance. The minister in turn nodded slowly, saying, "Yes, we have in fact already identified certain products that the German economy could benefit from."\n\nThe Pakistani looked at the documents. "These we can certainly provide, I believe. We also identified certain German goods and services that Pakistan would benefit from. We hope in the long term to have Pakistan match Germany's prosperity, or at least leave India behind in the dust."\n\nThe minister put a finger to his chin in thought and decided to somewhat change the subject. "Well, Minister, we can certainly try. But in the meantime, I've heard good things about the carpets in this region. I was actually struggling to get the Führer a suitable gift for his birthday, and was wondering if you, if you could..."\n\nThe Pakistani diplomat smiled. "Why, of course, Minister.""
 PAK_Germany.6.a: ""I can show you some.""

 PAK_Germany.7.t: "Toil"
 PAK_Germany.7.desc: "The children toiled away at looms and other carpet-making machines. Their stories were all variations of the same theme. They had been sold to work by their parents because they could not be fed, or because their parents needed the money more than they needed their children.\n\nBefore they had at least been able to look around and see the outside world. But inside, all there was was a few slivers of light, the carpet machines, the screaming foreman demanding more, and work unceasing. The few children that managed somehow to get hold of books could hardly read them. If they had been able to read, they might have known what this was—debt slavery—but they spent the time a German child would have spent on learning instead bent over the loom and so stood no chance of knowing.\n\nIt took several children getting hurt before the latest carpet was made ready. The foreman all but tore the carpet from them and took it to the factory owner, who looked at it approvingly. It may not have been the factory's best work, but which German would know to appraise it correctly?\n\nThe factory owner sold the carpet to a middleman. For an instant he thought to take some money off their debts as a reward. He squelched the impulse—the debts would never be paid off even if he did. Besides, he needed every paisa for his next mansion, or to buy more looms which more children would work over. He turned around and shouted at another group of children to work faster.\n\nWhen the carpet reached the Führer's office, he had it laid down on the floor before a place of honour where Hitler's portrait hung. He gazed at it admiringly, and spared no thoughts for anything but its beauty. Its origin did not matter—and he would not have cared even if he had known."
 PAK_Germany.7.a: "Meanwhile, the factory kept on working."

 PAK_Germany.8.t: "Smoke and Mirrors"
 PAK_Germany.8.desc: "Dense smoke filled the plush, velveted Governor's Room at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo. In lazy swirls it obscured the light coming down from the chandeliers and cast the tense faces of the German and Japanese diplomats in rippling shadows. On the right of the massive roundtable sat three veteran diplomats of the Auswärtiges Amt, dressed sharply in black-blue coats trimmed in silver and peaked visor caps. Opposing them were the austere Japanese, looking almost like businessmen, comparing notes and muttering darkly.\n\nA cigarette hung lazily from the corner of Freiherr Otto von Steinbach's mouth as he considered the conditions proposed by his stone-faced counterpart. One of the problems with modern diplomacy was that pedestrian insistence on satisfying the public about things they could not possibly understand - and would never bother considering lest they were riled up by some upstart. The Sphere's opening notes focused on 'bilateral recognition of conditions on the ground', 'an atmosphere of arms reduction and controlled leverage', and the 'exchange of mutually beneficial persons to achieve cooperation'. Had their German translator taken one too many glasses of sake?\n\nNot once was there any mention of the recognition of Pakistan as a state. Nothing regarding border limits, recognition, foreign relations. Which, ultimately, benefitted the noble Freiherr - his job at this junction was not to actually negotiate, but to buy time. And it was clear the Sphere was doing the same. Behind him, an aide discreetly passed him a note - "Two more days". In a single, swift movement, he crushed the cigarette against an ornate ashtray, and cleared his throat."

 PAK_Germany.9.t: "Herding Cats"
 PAK_Germany.9.desc: "Sweat dripped from the chin of Oberst von Lützow as a desk fan beat fruitlessly back against the humid air. Punjab was a sweltering boil of an assignment, but decades of Prussian discipline had ensured that despite his discomfort he would not even loosen his tie. A knock at the door announced the arrival of a local commander of the Pakistan Levies, here to give his report before their deployment in two weeks.\n\n"Well, Obergefreiter Khan? How has training with the new rifles fared - the men presumably preferred the NF-LAG to their old Lee-Enfields? What about the distribution of the desert nonperishable rations?"\n\n"Herr Oberst, I respectfully report that the shipment of new guns has not occurred as those funds have gone missing along with the local commander. Additionally, the nonperishable rations have been very reduced as some men issued them were not soldiers but farmers posing as them. As such, we are seeing reduced troop numbers."\n\nIt was only by a titanic effort of will that the Oberst did not detonate on the spot, and instead clenched his fist resting on the desk, a vein throbbing almost comically near his temple.\n\n"Obergefreiter. What percentage of the men that joined during our recruitment drive attended the most recent meeting with our instructors?"\n\n"Herr Oberst. I respectfully report 32% of the initial force remain with us."\n\n"You - "\n\n"Most apologies for the interruption, Herr Oberst. There is another report. During morning training with the anti-tank, there was an unfortunate accident involving the dropping of an ammunition."\n\n"... and what was the outcome?"\n\n"Herr Oberst. Of the 32% of men we have, 18% require the hospital.""

 PAK_Germany.10.t: "Back in Black" # to be removed
 PAK_Germany.10.desc: "The great steel behemoths of the Kriegsmarine swept through the boiling waters of the Arabian Sea, hulking forms cutting sharp white wakes through the waves. Against the deep blue of the ocean stood, in stark contrast, the jet black of their superstructures - painted in blatant defiance of tactical norms. With its runway marked by a single giant swastika, jutting defiantly into the seafoam, the carrier Adolf Hitler led the group in V-formation - flanked on one end by the cruiser Friedrich Barbarossa and the destroyers Emden, Wotan, and Erich Koellner, and on the other end by the cruiser Generaladmiral Warzecha and the destroyers Eisenfaust, Hochmut, and Erich Giese. Lurking deep beneath were six U-boats - all bearing arms that could obliterate the entire subcontinent they made for. The German navy, once bound to the memory of a broken Reich, had returned to the seas.\n\nOn the docks of Karachi Port, amidst the ambient low drone, beeping of alarms, and thousands of voices shouting, lay a deep sense of unease. The dockworkers that had seen a hundred vessels arrive and a thousand leave had also heard the rumours. That the Germans were coming not as friends, but as new conquerors. That the movement that had liberated them from Delhi's tyranny only sought to replace it with their own. And, for those few that had listened to the whispers from across the border- that when, not if, the Japanese had had enough, Karachi would be the first place burned into oblivion under the scorching rays of the Rising Sun.\n\nDeep beneath Wünsdorf, in the sterile white operations room of the OKW, Großadmiral Erich Topp watched with grim determination as aides with long staves pushed small scale icons of their ships across a giant map of the Arabian Sea. Across the peninsula of the Indian Subcontinent, in the Bay of Bengal, red markers denoting the approximate positions of the Imperial Navy saw far less movement. A single submarine flotilla, last thought to be near Sri Lanka, had not been touched in hours" # to be removed

 PAK_Germany.11.t: "Don't Blink"
 PAK_Germany.11.desc: ""Herr Steinbach, we cannot negotiate in good faith without honest reciprocation from your side. I have it on good authority that no fewer than ten nuclear submarines have just entered the Arabian Sea from the Suez Canal - and shortly, we will have photographic evidence."\n\nA small muscle pulsed in the corner of von Steinbach's eye. Wherever this Oriental had learned German, he had evidently missed the class regarding nobility. But years of diplomatic instinct kept his response smooth and measured:\n\n"I assure you that any movements towards the Arabian Sea remain in line with Reich policy as outlined in the Führer's note of one week ago. If you have evidence to the contrary, I would request you present it. Rather, I must insist that my friends from Tokyo consider that they have so far refused to countenance a single offer we have presented - who is really obstructing the peace process?"\n\nThey were no longer in the cosy Governor's Room - the massive Jubilee Ballroom had been opened for their purposes. Crowded along the sides of the conference table were representatives from every nation in the Sphere, notable members of the Pakt, and, at the south corner, international representatives. Notably absent were any Americans, though a trained eye would notice several 'Latin American' observers with sharp tanlines keenly listening in. The Freiherr would have stifled a laugh, were it not for the fact that the Japanese were absolutely right, and the Heer and Kriegsmarine had been behind schedule for almost two weeks. Britain and France had blinked once before. But this was their erstwhile ally, the men who saw death as more honourable than defeat."

 PAK_Germany.12.t: "Pay Your Own Way"
 PAK_Germany.12.desc: ""I appreciate you all taking the time to see me," said Major-General Syed Abid Hussain, hands clasped on the conference table. "I'm sure that a brother nation of the Einheitspakt can provide us with assistance in our time of trials." The men in front of him had names, but he felt it more appropriate to read them by his own nicknames. The Arms Dealer lounged back in his chair, looking at him over his nose and through dark-tinted glasses. The Businessman's smile was all teeth and no eyes. The Minister didn't seem like he could smile even if he wanted to.\n\n"That we can, my friend," said the Arms Dealer, sniffing. "How do you like the gun?" In front of Hussain was a hard-shell case, and a new Carl Gustaf m/45 inside. "Fresh off the factory line," said the Arms Dealer. Hussain took out one of the submachine guns. Solid craftsmanship, better than what most of the Levies would be used to.\n\n"I believe we should discuss payment," said the Businessman, opening the folders in front of him. "Now, we can issue these guns on a five-year lease, with payments to be made by the Pakistani government on a yearly-"\n\n"No," said Hussain, the word escaping his grasp. Curious eyes turned to him, though he did not buckle under their gaze. "I'll act as the primary lessee. Send me the bill directly." He knew it was going to be steep, but a big-time landlord like him had the money. That he was spending it on outfitting for the Pakistan Levies, who could not be properly funded by the government, was frustrating. At the same time, he saw an opportunity to earn some favours, and he was not shy about it.\n\nThe Minister looked nervous at this uncommon arrangement, but seeing Hussain's steely gaze, he sighed and nodded to the Arms Dealer, who clapped in celebration. "Alright then, I'll get my boys and your boys to hash out the finer details. Pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Major-General.""

 PAK_Germany.13.t: "The EEC's Eastern Frontier"
 PAK_Germany.13.desc: "Everything about the ballroom sparkled; the chandelier, the crystalware, the polished floorboards and the gold trimming which lined the walls. To the ambassadors of European capital, here for the latest EEC conference, it was the kind of gaudy presentation unsurprising from lesser nations punching above their weight. Still, some thought, they'd been told that this whole affair had been arranged in days, some of the products so fresh off the factory line that you could dust them for tiny fingerprints, and they were of impressive quality for their speed.\n\nThey had been less enamoured with the speakers at this conference until a dignified white woman took the stage, and identified herself as Jennifer Musa, an Irish-born citizen of Pakistan, here to show that this little corner of South Asia was more familiar to them than they thought. She wore a green anarkali suit, embroidered with more gold that caught the light of the ballroom, and she spoke clearly and softly, a comforting trait of her previous life as a nurse.\n\n"In my time in both worlds, I found many similarities between Europe and Pakistan. We seek to promote and uphold the virtues that have made our nations strong and pure. Even as our values are undermined by invaders, hostile to our traditions, we seek to preserve them through strength of will. Though we may differ on some of the particulars, we believe in many of the same things: duty towards family, nation and God. I ask that those in attendance today recognise this, and place your faith in the newest member of the Pakt. You will learn as I have that your trust will be well-rewarded."\n\nWhile most of the Germans had been dismissive, others were open to what Musa proposed. It was a French businessman, a representative of Renault who had admired some of the business practices he had seen, who took her words to heart. When she was finished speaking, he made his way to the nearest telephone, and dialed his local business partner."

 PAK_Germany.14.t: "Namarië"
 PAK_Germany.14.desc: "Practically everyone in the Pakistani government of any degree of notability was being bundled into the German planes in Lahore. Anyone with any degree of potential utility of the Reich was issued a ticket and a visa and told to grab their possessions and board the planes at the airport.\n\nThe highest-ranking official excluded was General Akbar Khan, head of the Pakistan Army, left behind to continue the fight. Civilian and military vehicles fought for space near the airfield as Pakistan Army soldiers and Pakistan Levies tried and failed to keep order. People were shoved onto planes and off them, families ran the risk of being separated, and chaos was increasingly total as the evacuation wore on.\n\nAkbar Khan, cursing out the chaos for the umpteenth time, saw a VIP plane depart and thanked Allah for small mercies. At least the Prime Minister and the Cabinet had gotten out safely.\n\nSaid Prime Minister on the plane had his head in his hands.\n\n"God! I hate it, I hate it so much," Feroz Khan Noon murmured to himself as bitter feelings swirled. "Now I'm stuck on this sinking ship, some pathetic imitation of the damned Titanic. I should've fled to India when these Pakistan Movement fanatics came to Nurpur Noon, instead of joining up with them." Cursing his life choices, Noon watched Pakistan grow ever more distant from the plane window."

Nowhere was this more clear than in a regional Pakistan Levies base somewhere in the Province.\n\n"Where are those detachments, anyway? Where the hell have they gone?"\n\nThe colonel's secretary put his phone down, letting it drop in his dissatisfaction. "I don't know where they went. I tried to phone every single one of them. No matter how far they were from the Indians, not one of them responded. We just don't know where they've gone."\n\n"Keep looking, damn you," the colonel shouted. As the secretary got about doing it, there was an angry clamour outside. A lieutenant rushed in, his face gelid, and stammered out: "There's a mob of angry, armed people outside! T-they want us to release their family members from the Levies!"\n\nThe colonel made a dismissive gesture. "Can't they see we're trying to find those goddamn family members ourselves? When we can find those idiots, we'll give their moron family members what they want."\n\n"We can't give them what they want," the secretary said. "Most of them are dead, it looks like. We—""

 PAK_Germany.17.t: "The Watch on the Havel"
 PAK_Germany.17.desc: "The airplanes that left Akbar Khan behind disgorged any number of exiles that then set up shop across the Reich.\n\nSome of them tried to assimilate and forget about everything that had led them to this point. Others, on the other hand, refused to give up the dream of restoring the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. They set up associations for the restoration of Pakistan, insisting above all else that Azad Hind was an illegitimate Hindu occupier and that they and their Japanese puppet-masters would be driven out by righteous force of arms.\n\nNothing really came of it, though. They couldn't even drum up local support. Any German that was in the now and willing to listen to Pakistani exiles' ranting had to resist the urge to say that the Germans had fled the Indus Valley with their tails between their legs and expelled Pakistan from the Pakt for a simple, good reason. The hundred or so such interested people in any given region constantly found themselves torn between breaking the truth to them and simply leaving them to it.\n\nA year passed. Two years. Three. No sign of an uprising. Akbar Khan was incommunicado. There was no news from any Pakistan Levies, nothing reminiscent of a Muslim League National Guard uprising. The few people that could get news from their relatives in the Indus Valley heard that no one there even really thought or spoke about Pakistan anymore. Hopelessness characterized the Pakistani exiles' meetings these days, even if they mouthed the same old pieties about a "to be free Pakistan".\n\nAmidst the inertia, a realization set in. But none of them would ever think to admit that Germany was the one that had left Pakistan in its current nonexistent state. So they kept on talking about Indian invaders and Japanese enemies of Islam, like people picking at embers asking why there was no fire."
