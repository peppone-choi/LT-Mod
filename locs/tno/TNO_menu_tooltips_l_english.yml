  TNO_ODF_icon_tt_delayed: "§WAntarctica§!. The Exiled Continent. The Great White Nothing. Average temperature: §m-21.6 Celsius§!. Bounded by titanic cliffs, encased in glaciers, blasted by katabatic winds, it is the most inhospitable place on Earth, completely unfit for prolonged human habitation. However, from the moment the first explorers sighted the ice shelves on its shores, its §Gmysteries§!, §Bwonders§!, and §Rdangers§! summoned the bravest of them inland. From the coastal probes of H.M.S. Erebus and Terror to the polar ventures of §RScott§!, §GAmundsen§!, and §BShackleton§!, the last unexplored place on Earth's surface called to the intrepid.\n\nThe purpose of these ventures has always been to stake a nation's claim to this desert.

Their desire to defeat each other is eclipsed only by the continent's indifference to the works of §GMan§!. Strong or weak, rich or poor, when the food runs out and the fuel runs low, there is only the §Bsilence§!, the §Bcold§!, and the §Rgnawing hunger that makes men do unspeakable things§!.\n\n§WAntarctica§! awaits..."
