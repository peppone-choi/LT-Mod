 antarctica_aao_flavor.1.t: "Bravo"
 antarctica_aao_flavor.1.desc: "Raborn's mind stirred as he slept. It was 1950. He was a mere Captain then, proudly commanding the USS Bairoko, patrolling the ocean with the rest of the Atlantic Fleet. It was a simpler time, with no projects to manage, no barren ice sheets to watch over, and no spies to worry about. Just his duty to his country, that he had to fulfill. The United States was finally getting back on her feet after their humiliating defeat, and he was proud to help her recover.\n\nIt was 1954. He was a Rear Admiral then, slowly working his way up the chain of command. He found himself on the bridge of the Bairoko, in the Weddell Sea, just about 40 miles off of Signy Island. Today, the United States Military would be blowing up an island they had recently purchased from Argentina. Standard procedures. The suits had said that the explosion would be equal to six megatons of TNT. He couldn't even begin to picture what that would have looked like. Even now, he still couldn't imagine what six megatons looked like. As one of the men from Los Alamos later explained, the explosion had been \"bigger than predicted\". Instead of the planned six, the bomb had gone off with the force of fifteen megatons, rendering him blind for a moment as a second Sun lit up the sky over the South Orkneys. It was a rather impressive sight to behold, but the sixteen men who developed beta radiation burns were not nearly as impressed. The mandatory decontamination process only served to add insult to injury.\n\nThe alarm next to Raborn awoke him from his reminiscing. It was [GetYear], 0500 in the morning."
 antarctica_aao_flavor.1.a: "And he had barren ice sheets to watch over."
 antarctica_aao_flavor.2.t: "A Long Day"
 antarctica_aao_flavor.2.d: "Petty Officer Kevin Jackson sat in the cockpit of their floatplane with only a few millimeters of steel protecting him from the freezing chill of the Southern Indian Ocean winds. Next to him sat the hulking form of fellow airman James \"Splitpea\" Carol and a pile of state-of-the-art radar equipment. He paused for a moment to stare out the window. It was just starting to get dark out. He could just barely make out the shore of the Kerguelen Islands. The misty French islands were the keystone in New Swabia's logistics. Reedy had been sending them out to inspect these depots for any potential weaknesses.\n\nHe was exhausted. These missions had been a daily affair for what felt like weeks now. But he didn't dare allow fatigue to get to him. They were in international waters, well away from their cruiser base…and pretty close to enemy territory. Mistakes could be costly here, perhaps even deathly so.\n\nLooking at the radar device, he watched as the green light swirled around the screen like a hypnotic spiral. He counted the dots-small little points of green light to represent German boats. \"You were right Splitpea, even less supply boats than yesterday, much less than the day before that,\" he said, barely containing a yawn. \"Reedy will be happy to know the Germans seem to be losing interest in this spot. Let's keep an eye on it, alright\" his copilot replied.\n\nThat's when a light began to blink on the console. \"Storm's coming right between us and the path back to HQ. We should head back before it's too late\" Splitpea said nervously. Jackson thought about it a moment."
 antarctica_aao_flavor.2.a: "\"Yeah, you're right. I'd hate to get stuck out here, and I don't mind getting back to base a bit early.\""
 antarctica_aao_flavor.2.b: "\"And tell the Reedy we half-assed this on account of some wind? Hell no. The Australians have a place nearby we can land, Heard Island, let's just tough it out.\""

 antarctica_aao_flavor.3.d: "\"Well, shipmates, up next we have a wonderful piece of audio documentary for you. Please enjoy Jacques Cousteau's coverage of Antarctica marine life.\"\n\nTaika knew that the documentary would interrupt the well needed rhythm and blues that dominated McMurdo FM these days, but these guests of Antarctica needed to know a little about the territory they were intruding upon.\n\nIn the radio station, Matt and Taika listened to the Frenchman's coverage. It was an intriguing spectacle. The penguins, and their migratory habits, until Matthew interrupted the silence beholding the crew.\n\n\"Fascist bastard, it should be illegal to play his records over the airwaves.\" He grimaced.\n\n\"Really? Man…I was just starting to enjoy this documentary.\" Taika inquired.\n\n\"Damn right he is, he's loyal to the highest bidder. I heard the only reason he works for Vichy France is because of their control over Kerguelen. What a scumbag.\" Matt sighed.\n\n\"Damn…I'm sorry, i didn't know that. I can stop it if you'd like.\" Taika raised his hands up defensively.\n\n\"No worries, Taika, most people don't know how sleazy this wanker is. Besides, it's a good documentary, just a damn shame that he turned out to be such a terrible guy.\" Matthew sighed."
 antarctica_aao_flavor.3.a: "\"Who knows, with morals like that, maybe he'll jump back to our side someday.\""
 antarctica_aao_flavor.4.t: "Horses to Water"
 antarctica_aao_flavor.4.d: "Reedy stepped out of his helicopter onto the newly christened ground of Artigas Base. He could hear the engine sputter to a halt as he took in the atmosphere of the Uruguayan facility. After his time with the Brazilians Reedy had feared the worst, but looking around his worries began to dissipate in the morning air. In contrast to the miasmic cloud of fear and fatigue that hung over their northern cousins., the Urugayans were hard at work, smiling and chatting with each other with a look of determination in their eyes. Despite everything, Reedy couldn't help but smile to himself. That's when he saw Dr. Musso approach to greet him. Reedy smiled as he offered his friend a hand. \"I gotta say Doc, I like what you're doing with the place\"\n\nMusso smirked in acknowledgment and drew Reedy's gaze to the surrounding area with a finger. \"That's where we'll be placing our next habitat…and over there, I'm thinking an observatory\". He paused, lowering his cheerful tone \"Of course, first, we'll need to set up our defenses\" as he pointed to some soldiers setting up pykrete fortifications.\n\nReedy said \"Dreaming big already I see. We wanted to let you know that we are prepared to help you out against the Krauts in any way we can: fuel, weapons… even troops\".\n\nMusso shook his head solemnly. \"I thank you for the offer, but we simply can't accept. A delicate situation exists between us and the Germans and a Yanqui presence would only antagonize them\".\n\nReedy was shocked. \"Are you sure about this, We could do things quietly if-\"\n\nMusso cut him off \"I am not making this choice lightly. If they do come back, we will be able to face them\" Reedy sighed, nodding in defeat. Musso smiled \"Come now my friend let's not dwell on such gloomy topics. You must be cold. We have hot coffee and... stronger stuff back in the tent.\" The doctor's cheery demeanor was infectious to be sure, but Reedy wondered how long it would last. After all..."

 antarctica_aao_alert_event.10.desc: "Without warning, the American fort, hugging desperately onto the Antarctic ice cube, is showered in machine gun fire and mortar shells as Japanese Infantrymen advance through the snow and heavy winds on their bellies. With such an overwhelming display of force the Americans wouldn't dare attempt to fire back. They would likely attempt to repel the Japanese in the confines of their pykrete box, the Japanese commander reasoned. The gunfire ceases as the infantry form up on the steel hatch of the small structure. Slap charges are quickly deployed.\n\n\"On my mark!\" the officer yells through the roaring wind \"I want a grenade in there as soon as that door goes down!\"\n\nAdrenaline fills the veins of the men as they await their officer's mark. The bang is muffled only slightly by the wind as the steel hatch flies off its hinges. The crash of the door into the room is followed by the pop of the grenade.\n\n\"Mark!\"\n\nThe order is followed by a frantic rush into the room and then the detonation of the large gasoline bomb the Americans had left behind.\n\nAn American, through his rifle scope, watches as the bunker goes up in flames, and several enemy infantry frantically run outside covered in flames before collapsing in the snow in agony. Observing as the remaining Japanese retreated in horror, he considered firing at the fleeing soldiers, but reasoned it best not to waste any of his seven remaining bullets.\n\n\"It worked\" the Texan declared into his radio, \"We got 'em' on the run, but, with all due respect, we're fucked when they come back unless we can get some goddamn reinforcements.\" The radio squawked back..."

 antarctica_aao_alert_event.11.desc:0 ""What do you mean, "It was requisitioned?" That equipment was needed for repairing the reactor! I put in an urgent request for that gear!" shouted a very annoyed Wahlman. "I don't know what to tell you," the quartermaster replied, "The Japanese and Germans have been relentless lately, and everything we can spare is needed to keep the defenses shored up. You'll just have to wait another two weeks for the next supply shipment and hope that your gear comes with it."\n\n\n"Fuck's sake..." Wahlman sighed. He had hoped it would never come to this. Pulling the reactor building's alarm, he shouted "EVERYBODY OUT!" and gestured towards the door as the klaxon began blaring. Jeremy ran up to him as the last of the men were exiting the building, "What's going on?" he asked. "Another water leak, but we also lost power to control rods 3 through 6 and can't scram the thing due to broken equipment. The paperwork from this is going to be the death of me."\n\n\n"Run that by me again. You want me to do what exactly?" Admiral Raborn said. "Evacuate Ross Island, sir. McMurdo included. The radiation levels from the reactor are rising and I can't do anything about it safely with the equipment we have on hand," Wahlman said, "Unless you feel like giving everyone on base cancer in ten years, our best option is to evacuate. Sir."\n\n\nRaborn stood on the deck of the USCGC Northwind as he watched the last of the evacuation ships leave Ross Island, "Get me who ever is in charge of the Chemical Corps.

Raborn and Reedy were now working out of Dufek Station, Phleger was working overtime back in the U.S., Beale was stuck at Mawson, Hillary was home in New Zealand, and he hadn't heard a word from Rip since the incident.\n\nCoordinating the defense of the OAA from both the Germans and Japanese had become increasingly difficult increasingly quickly, as maintaining order between all the OFN forces on the continent now took several extra steps due to delays and lapses in communication. It wasn't long before the OAA began to feel the squeeze from its adversaries on both sides, with more and more border outposts being overrun on a daily basis. After only a few days, German and Japanese snowcats were racing to shake hands in the middle as they seized as much of the former OFN Administration as they could. Documents were burned, arrangements were made, and before long, Vice Admiral Raborn made the final call to abandon the territory and prevent any more needless bloodshed for an unavoidable outcome."

 antarctica_aao_alert_event.20.desc:0 "On the streets of Washington, the typical sounds of protest could be heard. The whistling of police officers in a vain effort to direct the human traffic. The angry shouts of popular slogans "No Americans in Antarctica" they decried, "Stop the American Empire!" The ranks of such a protest would typically be filled with bearded hippies in tie dye shirts. This march however did not have the permeating smell of marijuana, nor the persistent presence of bored college students. This protest was filled with ordinary folks, the sort of folks who are taken seriously by other ordinary folks, and more importantly, politicians.\n\nIn Canberra and Wellington similar demonstrations play out. Demands for an end to American administration of Antarctica, and calls for exclusive Australian and New Zealander administration of their respective Antarctic territories could be heard from Parliament buildings.\n\nThe Germans, taking advantage of the situation, had "accidentally" conducted various combat drills all over OFN Antarctic waters, and made a point to apologize to the Australians, the New Zealanders, and to the French of all people, for separate instances through their territory."

Every Australian and Kiwi here is out of work or scared of losing their job. The pound buys a nickel's worth; attitudes are going sour; quartermasters keep a gun under the counter; soldiers are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. And we sit listening to our radios while some Yank broadcaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be! We all know things are bad - worse than bad - they're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out any more. We sit in the office, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, "Please, at least leave us alone in our warm rooms. Let me have my kettle and my TV and my goose feather parka, and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone." Well, I'm not going to leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your Congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the Yanks and the territory and the Germans and the soldiers in the street. All I know is that first, you've got to get mad. You've gotta say, "I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!" So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,"

Medicine, first aid, tents, parachutes, water bottles, fire starters, lighter fluid, and rations, were in much shorter supply than was indicated on the manifest. This trend was consistent throughout the other storerooms as well.\n\nRobertson, as always, maintained a poker face.\n\n"I recommend that we run background checks," Bakeman continued, "on everyone wi..."\n\n"That won't be necessary Sergeant," Robertson interrupted, "Everything you need will be in the emergency supplies," Robertson said, passing a hefty envelope to Bakeman, "And in there is the authorization you need." Bakeman hesitated looking at the envelope, "The fuck you waiting for?"

 antarctica_aao.10.desc:0 "In ages long past, the Exile had known many kinds of fire. In the time of the great bombardment, it had known the molten blood of the earth as the crust heaved and cracked under the vicious assault of meteorites. In the time of the giant insects, when the Exile's back was lush and green, and the air purer, the smallest spark had ignited walls of flame that raced across the land. Cycles of blazing death and glorious rebirth marked the passage of aeons.\n\nAfter the Exile was cast south and clad in ice, the wood-and-copper boats came to its shores with fire born from coal and oil. The fires were a spluttering imitation of their forebears: too small to take life, barely enough to sustain it.\n\nBut today, there was a new fire, of a kind the Exile had never felt before. It was as if the fundamental laws of nature had been subverted. Matter buckled under its own weight, shedding light brighter than the sun, searing all that fell beneath the rays.\n\nGrey-clothed interlopers toasted their own genius, unaware that their creation had been seen by unfriendly eyes. A lonely grouping of snow-crusted watchers observed the second sun intently. Before long, they shuffled through the snow, eager to report what they'd seen to the other visitors. A flag of blue and white waved against the cloudless sky, a blazing torch at its center."

 antarctica_aao.20.desc:0 "The three men seated around the McMurdo conference table stirred uncomfortably as William 'Rip' Robertson showed them the photographs he'd taken with his team over the last few days. Embedded on a mountainside, Rip had had a perfect view of the detonation of a Nazi atomic weapon. The devastation wrought upon the Antarctic landscape made an impression on all assembled. "You're sure no one saw your team?" Vice Admiral Raborn asked Rip.\n\n"The Agency didn't send me here for my eye for photography," Rip replied with a smirk.\n\n"What's the yield compared to an American device?" Howard Beale, head of the Australian division of the OAA, asked.\n\n"On par with many of ours," said Rip, "It seems the Germans have kept pace with our progress, perhaps surpassing us in some regards." Edmund Hillary, Chief of the New Zealand Antarctic Research Program, cocked an eyebrow. "Surpass?"\n\n"Given reports from Langley and what my team observed, it seems the Germans are entering a new phase of nuclear development. Redeployment of equipment, transfer of personnel, everything indicates the Germans are redoubling their nuclear efforts. It's entirely possible, almost a certainty even, that the test we witnessed is only a taste of what's to come."\n\n"I must communicate these findings to my government immediately," said Beale as he rose from the table. "Indeed, this is dire news," echoed Hillary. Raborn, pensively gazed at the photographs of a despoiled landscape, glancing up to dismiss the spook before him. "Thank you for your report. Are you certain your team can maintain field readiness in case of another test?"\n\nRip stood up from the table, "I have top men on it.""

 antarctica_aao.30.desc:0 "McMurdo Station was the closest one got to a city in Antarctica, capable of providing shelter and even a measure of comfort for several thousand souls. As opposed to older bases, McMurdo featured a number of interlinked insulated corridors and tunnels, allowing one to walk from one end of the base to the other without ever feeling the cold, a walk that the leader of the Australian Research Program, Howard Beale, appreciated.\n\nNuclear power changed Antarctic exploration, allowing bases to be virtually self-sufficient in terms of energy. Bases of the future might even be able to grow enough crops that they didn't need to rely on resupply at all, or so Beale, a proponent of all things nuclear, hoped.\n\nSuch dreams of habitation, even colonization, would remain dreams so long as the political deadlock that consumed the OFN Antarctic Administration continued. Nominally, the OAA was a joint effort between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, however, in practice, the Americans ran the show, to the great consternation of the other constituent members upon whose claim the OAA was staked in the first place.\n\nLogistically, the problems manifested in the form of parallel supply chains and incompatible infrastructure. Defensively, different weapons platforms demanded different ammunition. And personally, differing cultures and military traditions did little to promote unity.\n\nAs Beale turned another corner of McMurdo's many halls, he came face to face with one of the other realities of the OAA: its multiracial makeup. American blacks, refugees from Asian Commonwealth colonies, Maori all created problems, problems which Beale often had to resolve."

 antarctica_aao.40.desc:0 "Vice Admiral William F. Raborn wondered if this was the life all men of achievement eventually came to: being placed so highly that it was impossible to feel the consequence of one's decisions. Back when he served on and eventually commanded carriers in the Pacific, he could feel the effects of his choices, see the implications with his own eyes. When he oversaw the development of the Polaris missile, he could see the beast taking shape before his eyes. Every management decision taken was reflected in the work. But the cramped office at the heart of McMurdo was the furthest thing from the bridge of a carrier or a missile silo.\n\nRather than sea swells, waves of paperwork rolled at him. Instead of sending naval bombers into battle, he sent aides to and fro. Reports of German and Japanese transgressions, Australian supply manifests, and US submarine patrol routes through the Indian Ocean all crossed his desk. Unless of course his office was being used by the Australians and New Zealanders to argue who had jurisdiction over this or that.\n\nPolitics. Nothing else put Raborn further out of his comfort zone than dealing with tight-fisted bureaucrats. This job in Antarctica was his reward for ensuring Polaris was operational four years ahead of schedule. He was only a year in and he was anxious about the future. Antarctica was an utterly alien place. He had only just begun to grasp its vicissitudes. Two things made this place dangerous: Man and Nature. And both were arrayed against him."

Wahlman, one of the nuclear engineers, made his way through a sea of workers, soldiers, and other personnel before setting his tray down at one of the long rectangular tables. He overheard a man talking across the table.\n\n"I tell you, those ocean sediments we collected are huge news. Some of those could be millions of years old," the young researcher said. He had a gleam in his eyes as he went on about what they'd found. The OAA may have been established to fuel the fires of an ever more militarized Cold War, but men like him continued to fuel the locomotive of scientific discovery in Antarctica, from studying the weather to observing the continent's fauna.\n\nAnother researcher, clad in a military uniform, piped up, "While you fellas are scooping up the soil, we're conducting test flights on the most extreme weather conditions in the world." Wahlman watched, silently sipping his drink, while military and civilian researchers engaged in light banter, throwing quips and jokes at each other. He knew more than anyone there that the global powers had much interest in the research conducted on the frozen continent. Especially anything pertaining to nuclear energy.\n\n"Hey, no matter what we all are doing," said one scientist, "it's certainly more interesting than whatever the guys back home are up to." To that the whole table cheered. Regardless of their goal or background, every researcher at McMurdo Station knew one thing; they were pioneers. And that was exciting to every single one of them."

From his days carrying out anti-Kriegsmarine patrols in the Atlantic during the war to commanding carrier groups in its aftermath, he always endeavored to add his own personal touch to an assignment. When he was assigned to the OAA, he was given a clear task: keep the Germans and the Japanese out of the OFN's Antarctic waters and maintain operational capability in the Indian Ocean.\n\nClear, perhaps, but certainly not simple, Reedy thought as he examined the latest reports. The Kriegsmarine had been more docile in recent months, a possible reflection on the state of the Wehrmacht, however the Japanese had been increasing their naval presence in Antarctica and routinely probing the OFN's territory by land and sea.\n\nThe latest incursion featured two destroyers sailing some twenty kilometers into OAA waters. Reedy knew he could not let this challenge go unanswered. The Japanese understood force, so Reedy would speak their language. He would echo their gesture, sending two destroyers twenty kilometers into Japanese waters. Reedy's job was not to escalate, but to do nothing at all would do just that."

 antarctica_aao.70.desc:0 "Kenneth Wahlman kept his hands behind his back, and watched as the heart of McMurdo's nuclear reactor came to life. The loud thuds that echoed across the building every time they probed the core were something that Wahlman had grown to be accustomed to. He could see the excited glances that the new engineers shared with one another. Nobody could blame them. McMurdo Station's nuclear reactor was truly a sight to behold, helping to sustain the lives of up to 1,500 people in the largest settlement on the continent. And all that thanks to a core not much bigger than an oil drum.\n\nHis new colleagues kept their child-like wonder as he took them around the facility. Nuclear energy had the potential to bring good to many people. The new researchers were evidently thrilled about it, and Wahlman couldn't say he wasn't too. But no matter how much time he spent near it, every time Wahlman looked at that small core, every time he heard its ominous call, he felt itching doubt.\n\nThe reactor was powerful, but fragile. A small slip could upend the OFN's entire Antarctic project. Worse than that, it could cost lives. Too many of them. He couldn't let it happen. Not in his watch. He turned to the new engineers, and put up his best smile."

So when the phone rang, Beale truly had no idea who could be calling.\n\nToday, however, Beale would be the one doing the calling; he needed to speak to his counterparts back in Australia, responsible for handling the logistics for the Australian contingent of the OFN's territory on the continent.\n\n"Listen," he said, "we can exert more influence over how the territory is used, its management, its personnel, but to do that we need infrastructure to keep pace with the Americans'. I'm not asking for the moon, I'm asking for a few bloody snowcats."\n\nBeale waited for the man on the other end of the line to finish his customary spiel about logistical difficulties and transit times before adding, "I know the Cabinet's going to get the transcripts of this call, so I'll say this: a moment is fast approaching wherein Australia can make a great contribution to world freedom, a moment to police our own backyard and strike back against the Japanese enemy who'd jump at the chance to have us blockaded, starving, on our knees.

A state of cold war reigned over the continent, just as it did over the wider world. The exploration of the planet, once the endeavor of intrepid pioneers, was now solely carried out in the name of expansion and one-upmanship.\n\nThat was why Hillary had eagerly accepted this position representing New Zealand in the OAA. He was here to see the sights and challenge himself, of course, but the moment he got the invitation from his government, he knew this was his moment to dream bigger.\n\nHe yearned for a slice of the world, however small, primarily committed to the preservation and expansion of the human spirit. It might seem a distant fantasy now, but as God was his witness he would do his best to see it done.\n\nIt was not easy, attempting to pursue a policy of humanism in these harsh environs. Raborn, Beale, Reedy - these were men wholly focused on carrying out their orders or looking out for their own self interests. Were they bad men? No. Hillary liked them well enough, but they did not share his vision for a peaceful and cooperative administration: one that would spite the Germans and Japanese by working with others, not by shunning them and turning inwards.\n\nGaze sweeping the snowy fields, he was warmed by a wanton determination."

It was carrying a legend.\n\nDespite the blistering cold, soldiers and scientists grinned as the plane touched down and ground to a halt. Whispers spread like wildfire. "He was on Scott's expedition in 1910," some said. "He was the first person to find Scott's body." Others remarked that he was the most experienced Antarctic explorer still breathing, that he was a polymath whose scientific acumen ranged from the Earthly to the cosmic, from the development of radar to the study of the sea.\n\nHoward Beale stood next to Rear Admiral Reedy on the tarmac as the plane's door slowly opened, "I knew the Canadians were sending a liaison, an expert," said Beale, "but Jesus... a survivor of Scott of the Antarctic's expedition?"\n\n"I've read every word the man's written about magnetic countermeasures," said Reedy, "If we'd more readily adopted his proposals, the fight against the Wolf Packs may have gone differently."\n\n"Now that he's here, maybe we can take the fight to the damn Nazis. I'm sure he's got many ideas to improve overland travel."\n\nA shadow filled the plane door, and the sunlight fell on Sir Charles Seymour Wright.

Several engineer units were being reassigned to Antarctica, ostensibly to shore up infrastructure and establish new defensive networks, but their accompanying material was far in excess of the jobs they would be expected to do. The personnel lists also struck Raborn as odd, a dozen doctors of various fields, not exactly the type to hoist shovels in the frozen dark. Clearly their mission wasn't just solely about shoring up infrastructure. Apparently, he was to expect a visit from some ranking officers in the Army Corps of Engineers as well, although further details were sparse.\n\nRaborn was no stranger to military secrecy, having climbed his way up the ranks of the Navy. He wasn't concerned that he was being kept out of the loop, but it begged the question: if a Vice Admiral of the US Navy wasn't being told what the men under his command were really up to, just how serious was this project?

Hillary even considered sending a letter of congratulations to the man before being rebuffed by the paranoiacs in security.\n\nHillary sighed.

While Hillary was stuck fighting for scraps of funding or supplies for scientific endeavors, Leal could redirect his base's entire effort towards such goals with a wave of a hand. Hillary remained trapped at the base, only able to witness the continent's majesty from afar.\n\nIn the distance, the southern wastes seemed to call to him, and Hillary's mind began to wander.

 antarctica_aao_leaders.10.desc:0 ""I get that the times are changing, but Edmund, are you insane? A woman in Antarctica, let alone one on an independent research mission, would be a disaster. It's as plain as that."\n\nRaborn and Hillary had been talking circles for three hours now. Hillary had long been a proponent of opening OFN Antarctic bases to the other sex — if they didn't then they were no better than Jerry or the so-called pan-asians — but despite the consent of all OFN member states, it had yet to happen. Even the National Science Foundation was starting to amend their previous declarations on the topic. So, Hillary argued, why the hell didn't the US Navy simply rescind its policy on transporting women to Antarctica?\n\nHe had been wearing Raborn down for months now, pestering him with weekly meetings on the subject, but the Vice Admiral had yet to budge. Thankfully for Hillary, he had made a plan, and now was just the time to announce it.\n\n"Think what you like, William, but if you won't sign off on it then I'll have her brought in some other way. It's not as though this administration has taken a stance on her presence, so I don't see why she wouldn't be welcomed."\n\nRaborn sighed heavily, putting his pen down and staring down Hillary for the first time this meeting, "It's not as though she'll be able to get here without the acceptance of the Navy. They patrol these waters, and the moment they catch whiff of this little stunt they'll be ready to send her straight back home."\n\n"Ah, yes. The US Navy, the guardian of the free and enlightened world, is going to — very publicly — send a single harmless woman back home over some outdated policies. I've already contacted some friends in New York to start assessing candidates and preparing a ship to New Zealand. All that's left to do is see if you decide to let her dock.""

McMurdo occasionally received expansions, being one of the few bases still growing since the Scramble for Antarctica, but these expansions were contested by the various factions on-site.\n\nRight now, Hillary and Beale were meeting to discuss which of their countries would receive the latest accommodations: Australia, New Zealand, or would both share?\n\n"For our part," said Beale, "we'd like to use the new habitats to host a contingent of Australian soldiers. It would greatly increase our capability to provide security on the continent, and defend McMurdo."\n\nHillary sighed. "More soldiers, Howard? We have an opportunity to study this place in detail, for the first time in human history. Who knows what discoveries await? We're committed to expanding our scientific facilities."\n\n"Then why don't we divide the space evenly? Arguing between ourselves only gives the Americans more control of McMurdo's future.

Washington now knows it has friends amongst your Liberal Party."\n\n"Of which you can count me. Now tell me, what proposition do you have for us?"\n\n"Quite simply, we want to build a bridge, however informal, between our nations and redress the balance of power in Antarctica. If Chile's possessions on the continent are violated by either Argentina or the Empire of Japan, the Organization of Free Nations will commit its full support to Chile," Phleger raised a finger, "In whatever form is required," he added gravely. Then, softening, he said, "Naturally, we hope such a situation never develops, and to ensure that it doesn't, Vice Admiral Raborn will increase naval patrols and freedom of navigation operations in the Southern Ocean."\n\nMaschke nodded slowly, "Quite generous. And what does the OFN get out of this arrangement?"\n\n"Should the worst come to pass in Antarctica, and open war erupt between the territories, Chile's holdings would give us a significant strategic advantage. We would want to be able to count on your support in such an eventuality.""

Today marked the conclusion of the squadron's freedom of navigation operation around the continent, the first time such an operation had been conducted on a large scale. During the Scramble for Antarctica, numerous powers had staked a claim to the frozen wastes and brought naval forces to support them, however those of the OAA had never before brazenly paraded through the littoral of Antarctica with the intent of proving the other territories' impotence in their own waters.\n\nReedy had been nervous when Herman Phleger ironed out an agreement with the Chileans ensuring mutual cooperation. Reedy felt that he and his men would be taking all the risk. For weeks now he'd expected to be fired upon, either by the Japanese or the Germans, but they hadn't. Sonar and radar had detected contacts shadowing the squadron but not one ship had challenged their passage. For all intents and purposes, the operation was a complete success.\n\n"Sir?" said Lieutenant Walsh, "Radar's spotted a contact to the north, flying low. Believed to be an Argentinian reconnaissance plane, given our proximity to their territory. I agree with the assessment."\n\nReedy scanned the horizon and spotted a small aircraft battling headwinds as it approached the flotilla. It was definitely an unarmed recon plane. While Reedy had no issues with testing the former Axis allies, he was apprehensive about an international incident involving the Argentinians. The OFN had enough enemies already. The plane flew a parallel course with the squadron, but an hour later, returned home."

The first trickle of Wehrmacht had sent the command staff into a flurry of activity, relocating the defectors to McMurdo and thence into captivity, but now Lush was watching as a few dozen more Germans approached his command with their hands in the air.\n\nLush's second-in-command, Chris Bird, vocalized the confusion everyone felt quite succinctly: "What the fuck is going on in New Swabia?!"\n\nLush and his men, bundled in their Canada Goose parkas, exited the command post and began working their way towards the approaching defectors. As they got within a hundred meters of the Germans, gunshots began to ring out across the snow. Lush's men began to panic and take aim at the defectors, several of whom had already thrown themselves on the ground. Lush got on the radio, "Hold fire, I repeat, hold fire! The defectors are unarmed! They're not doing the shooting!"\n\n"Then who is?" Bird replied.\n\nLush looked to the horizon and saw several plumes of snow rising into the air. A moment later, a column of snowcats trundled over the icy ridge beyond the defectors, disgorging dozens of infantrymen onto the plain. One of the cats began blasting German from a loudspeaker at the defectors.

However, that was for his colleagues to deal with, for Raborn and the OAA, the only struggle they needed to concern themselves with was the Nazis on their border.

Some still fondly recalled the nights of riot in Brisbane, in November 1942, when they had had the opportunity to teach the yanks a lesson: the Americans were stealing their alcohol and their women, just because they were better paid and dressed.\n\nNot much had changed since Brisbane, and a few leaflets had begun to circulate, similar to those that had inundated Australia during the Indonesia campaign; with the Americans soon to leave, it was time for the Australians to make their discontent known again. A circle of leaders was ready to strike hard if necessary, and leave a vivid memory of their anger for Admiral Raborn.\n\nThe surroundings of the airstrip was being slowly crowded, as more Australian soldiers joined to watch the Americans depart. Soon, cries and chants rose. A few men were coordinating the protest, exhorting the soldiers as military police stepped in to disperse the mob. Leaflets passed from hand to hand, insults flew, and the American soldiers began to turn to face the crowd. The MPs stepped back cautiously."

A crowd of battered, shivering, and very angry soldiers, Australians and New Zealanders, were gathering around him and other Americans. They had all set up a camp around an abandoned German base far from the old OAA border. After days of waiting, a shipment of Canada Goose parkas arrived to replace their tattered war weary outerwear. They were comfortable, had many useful pockets, and were most importantly, warm. As such they were a sought after item amongst the members of the OAA.\n\n"We were supposed to share these!" One desperate soldier shouted. An American stepped up to answer, "Colonel Carter distributed the jackets to us, so stop complaining and get back in line. There will be more coming. These are minor supply issues."\n\nJames watched helplessly as both sides came closer and closer to a fight. One Australian laughed bitterly, "And who's Colonel Carter? Let me take a guess and say he's another goddamn Yank," and before a punch could be thrown, James placed himself in the middle of the crowds. It seemed the terrified look in his face managed to pull everyone away from their anger."

Has your own leadership been notified? Anyone?"\n\n"The proper authorities are aware," said the officer, uncovering a folder from behind his back. Its contents he let spill on the table. Pictures and a report with a blacked out name, which Noah looked over quickly. Accusations of "disloyalty" among Aussie and Kiwi soldiers. What rubbish.\n\n"Additionally, a load of supplies has been reported missing in a sector where you and other Australian personnel operate," the CIA officer said with a robotic, monotone tone. It made Noah grit his teeth, "Where do you think we are, fucking Disneyland? Things go missing here all the time," he grumbled, "If anything it was probably a Yank who was stealing. We haven't gotten shit from you wankers." He read the reports again, and the anger seemed to only continue boiling. Thinking about where his other arrested comrades could be, the hypocrisy of the CIA, and the injustice of it all, it made him want to shake the table.\n\nNoah spit on the report, "The only traitor in this room is you.""

An Australian glared behind them.\n\n"Fucking Yanks," he muttered, "how come some newcomers get paid more than me?" He didn't mean for the Americans to hear. But one of them turned around, "Do you have a problem?" he asked.\n\nThere was a long and tense moment before a response came. The Australian thought about it. He thought about how the Americans seemingly got it better than everyone. Better pay. Warmer clothes. Bigger lodgings.\n\nHis face went red and, spitting he shouted, "Yes! Yes I do! You upjumped monkey!" He pushed one of the Americans, who got too close. The American pushed back. Then came a punch. It was followed by another, and a kick, and then another.\n\nSoon all the men on the line were embroiled in a brawl. Sharp words were thrown and bitter punches answered. Shouts and cries were heard as one American was kicked in the chin and collapsed to the ground. The soldier did not stand up again. An Australian fell as well, his pleas drowned by an orchestra of fury as he was kicked and trampled on.\n\nOnly after the authorities quelled the fighting, and the battered and tired soldiers licked their wounds, did they realize what they had done.

He acknowledged his own part in this deterioration: the secrecy surrounding Iceman had hurt the cohesion of the OAA. Raborn consoled himself with the fact that he, at least, had no choice in the matter, but in these past few days it had become less and less of a comfort.\n\nReedy was the last to arrive and took his seat next to Raborn. Beale, Hillary and Wright sat on the opposite side of the table. The gulf between seemed larger than ever. "So, gentlemen," said Raborn, "What's on the agenda today?"\n\nBeale and Hillary shared an uneasy glance. Hillary stood up first, "Antarctica is one of the least understood places on Earth. Scientifically, it could be one of the most important places to humanity. I want to see the OAA refocus on scientific investigation and exploration. We've turned the last unspoiled continent into a warzone. I'm not going to go along with it anymore. I'm formally requesting a change in leadership, based on true cooperation and autonomy."\n\nBeale interrupted, "I understand the need for science, truly, but we live in dangerous times, and I believe that a firm hand is needed. Centralized authority is necessary, as well as a strong military presence. But I do concur with Edmund that a change in leadership is needed to soothe the tensions we all can clearly see. I'm also formally requesting a leadership change, but I would like an Australian to be in charge."\n\nRaborn nodded slowly. None of this surprised him. In fact, he agreed with much of what they said. From the look on Reedy's face, however, he could tell his subordinate disagreed vehemently. "Charles, you haven't said a word."\n\n"What can I say?" said Wright, "I love Antarctica, but nothing good can happen here so long as our men are at each other's throats.

Raborn spoke highly of you both." Both men shook his hand, but said nothing as they sat down, "I called you here to introduce myself, get to know the situation here, and also to go over the changes I'll be making," Hillary sighed at word 'changes', but they both kept listening and answered his questions.\n\nAfter the briefing, Hillary and Beale were dismissed and left wordlessly. Rickover got up from his desk and crossed his arms behind his back as he looked out the window. Raborn had warned him about this. Beale and Hillary were upset by what Raborn had been doing, and it was clear that their resentment extended to himself.\n\nRickover would not be deterred, however. For the OAA to survive and stand against tyranny, it needed to be strong. As it stood presently, the United States alone had the vision and willpower to provide this strength.\n\nHe looked upon the snowy landscape as if it were a canvas, and his mind began to paint new images upon it. He saw fortresses and war machines, soldiers, guns... a force capable of challenging the OFN's enemies. And beyond that, he saw a world protected from the evils of fascism and hatred.

Every report and every file that had been hidden from him. Down to the last word. Beale could admit to himself that he didn't have grievances with most American plans. He had been impressed with their pet project, Iceworm, and all the possibilities it could bring. He marveled at the promise of giving Australia, and the OFN as a whole, a defensive bulwark stronger than anything before. All thanks to nuclear power.\n\nIf only the bloody Yanks would stop hogging it all to themselves. Reading at an almost leisurely pace, Beale considered his next move. He'd have to set up a meeting. A discussion over a good dinner, perhaps. With this new position he could negotiate with the Americans, argue and negotiate the way to victory. From there he could involve Australia further, not only in Antarctica but the OFN writ large. He also relished the possibility of deploying more nuclear reactor systems across the OAA, greatly increasing livability, after the kinks had been worked out of course.\n\nHoward Beale slumped back in his seat, for a moment dazed at the work ahead.

We can also expect strong winds coming from the northwest..."\n\nHaving had enough, Wahlman turned off the radio and let the announcer's voice fade into static. Now all that accompanied him was the howl of the wind as it battered on his dorm window. Winter in Antarctica was long and hard, Wahlman knew as much, he had gone through a couple already. That dark blanket would stay over the sky for many months, breaking the spirits of men across the frozen wastes. That's why they needed the energy of the nuclear reactor. Like a beating heart it would keep the station alive through thick and thin. All the while, Wahlman was responsible for that heart.\n\nHe sat on his desk and took a long sip of coffee, shifting around a pile of papers. The reactor would need more power to plow through the winter months. On top of that, it would have to keep working without malfunction. That was the real challenge. Who would have guessed that delicate equipment doesn't always bode well with Antarctica's hostile climate. Just like humans. Wahlman smirked to himself, and set down his coffee."

"So, what do you think, Kenneth?" Jeremy asked, standing back and letting the senior engineer make his assessment.\n\nWahlman pursed his lip for a moment. "Well, it's not just one fissure. I can see at least two more," He saw Jeremy's mouth drop open in shock. And maybe embarrassment for not having noticed them. But Wahlman couldn't blame him, the hairline cracks were minuscule. If one didn't see it, they'd think the reactor was chugging along just fine. Their size didn't prevent them from causing harm, though. If water started to leak, then it could potentially damage the inner shield. That would need to be patched up immediately. Accidents are never affordable in Antarctica, especially in winter. What Wahlman scratched his head over, however, was the cause.\n\nPerhaps it was an issue from assembly? Moisture loss can also cause hairline cracks, and Antarctica is as dry as it gets.

Wahlman jumped at the voice behind him, he whipped his head around to find Jeremy with a sheepish smile on his face. "Jesus Christ," Wahlman said, out of breath, "Don't do that again." Jeremy raised his hands as a show of peace, displaying a lighter. The older engineer looked at it as if it were a gun. "Don't worry, I know better than using this inside the building. C'mon, the view from Observation Hill is great now that winter is over. Let's take a break."\n\nFor a brief moment, Wahlman felt himself wanting to say yes. Then he thought of the prior months, of how they had managed to cover the cracks. It had cost them comfort, and it had given them working hours stretching over entire days. And despite it all, it felt like they continued to hop from one emergency to the next. He turned away from Jeremy, almost feeling the young man's smile fall.\n\n"Don't bring that lighter in here again," Wahlman called out, walking off.

Seafoam and crystalline water marked the coast's end, while tropical trees in all shades of vibrant green lined its beginning. Despite the sights all around him, he couldn't help but shift uncomfortably. Like the reactor had followed him all the way here. Worries and questions plagued him every time his eyes closed. Were they keeping with the safety procedures? What if there was an emergency?\n\nA crumbled newspaper sat abandoned on the sand. He tried to read the news as a distraction, but they weren't very comforting either. Beside it was a card from his family back home. Like his coworkers, they told him to relax. Wahlman knew that, he just... wasn't sure how to. His eyes glanced over to a small wooden table, and he found a glimmering glass of lemonade. There was a time when he drank things other than coffee and water. He sighed and took the glass in hand, giving it a sip. It tasted different from what he remembered. It was better.

Without realizing, he had grown to enjoy his stay on the island. Coming back to see the reactor tightened up his whole body.\n\nHe shook his nerves up as he greeted the new engineers. Having more hands on deck would certainly help them next winter. After he brought them up to speed on everything, of course. For now, he limited himself to sharing small talk with them. The team was a multinational one, with bright minds from America, Australia, and New Zealand. They got to know each other with a hodgepodge of accents.\n\nAbove that, however, Wahlman was looking forward to seeing old faces. That's why he was troubled to see some of them missing. None of them had ever been late. "Where are the others?" He asked, "where is Jeremy?"\n\nHis brow furrowed further when he received dejected looks.

But this wasn't a normal situation.\n\n"Tritium...?" Raborn said, not raising his eyes from the papers.\n\nWahlman gulped before speaking, "Yes, Vice Admiral. A rare isotope of hydrogen. Radioactive."\n\nRaborn's face lost color in reaction to that word. And it lost more color as he continued to read. Tritium is rare to find in nature, but it's a common byproduct of nuclear reactor operations. And it had found its way to the purified drinking water that the reactor produced. Over a thousand people at McMurdo were possibly drinking irradiated water. That statement kept replaying in Wahlman's mind since the first test was conducted on the water, unearthing the issue. It bore down on him like a storm, so heavy it sank him lower into his chair.\n\n"We'll need to shut water production down," Raborn said, lifting his gaze. "Already done, sir," Wahlman answered. His vow had been to prevent the reactor from causing damage, and it'd done so anyway. Potentially to so many. Was it too late? "Mr. Wahlman," Raborn brought him out of his thoughts, "you'll be fully supported to conduct health checks on as many residents as possible. I will also make sure that you have resources to fix this immediately. But now we need damage control." The engineer stayed quiet. There was no way of going back and preventing this. The best they could do was face the present."

He looked at his watch periodically. Then, the door opened and a lanky young man stumbled into the facility. The tardy engineer went white as soon as he noticed Wahlman's eyes pinned on him.\n\n"Where were you?" Wahlman inquired. "You took way longer than needed to bring the tools I asked for." The young researcher retreated, mumbling some sort of apology. Then, another engineer walked into the scene, sympathetic for the newbie. "Oliver? Mate, I told you to stop wandering around looking at penguins. That's what our break is for!" He approached with an easy smile and patted the embarrassed young man on the back. "Don't be so hard on him, Kenneth," the mellow engineer said. Wahlman shook his head and walked off. Wandering? Penguins? Really? Then he turned around. "Did you at least bring the tools?" The young man nodded twice and then again, handing Wahlman a large tool box. Wahlman grunted his approval, and went to work. Maybe he's too cranky nowadays.\n\nRegardless, they'd been making... decent progress. There are multiple methods of removing radiation from water, and filtering had produced promising results so far. They needed to fix the gravel shield of the core, which breached and caused this whole mess. He stretched for a bit, and then went to pull out the equipment.\n\nWhen he looked through, he found that almost half of the tools were missing. "I need more coffee," He cursed under his breath."

Wahlman pressed his hand on the window, staring at the hazy streams of light that could be seen from the outside. There'd be little to see, even if the window wasn't murky. Just a few months of darkness, Wahlman thought bitterly. He was determined to not be affected like he was last winter, but the situation seemed even more precarious than June of last year.\n\nCombatting issues with the reactor was one thing. A problem inside the crew was a whole different beast. "So, I found these records," Jeremy called out, appearing from one of the hallways of lined cabinets, "like I told ya, nothing really suspicious." Wahlman nodded, taking a look at the pile of folders and papers that Jeremy spent the past half-hour scrounging up. He'd gotten used to his colleague's sudden appearances.\n\n"Are you sure a couple missing tools is worth all this trouble?" Jeremy asked, not really expecting an answer. Wahlman frowned, adjusting his glasses. The papers detailed information on all the personnel working under him. Tools had gone missing, the filtration system was mysteriously malfunctioning, and even the lights of the facility were going out once in a while. It was seriously delaying their work. And none of it had been happening before. At least, not before the new engineer crew arrived.\n\nEither something was wrong with his colleagues, or something was wrong with his head. Wahlman was a bit too proud to consider the latter. Even if so far, the records hadn't given any clues."

 antarctica_aao_nuclear.90.desc:0 ""That's uh... Yeah," Jeremy scratched the back of his head. He stood to Wahlman's side, both watching a thin column of black smoke billowing from the reactor building. Wahlman took a puff of his cigarette, with blank and restless eyes. The smoke set against the bright blue sky was oddly relieving. This emergency forced them to shut the reactor temporarily, but at least it didn't happen in the middle of winter. He tried to look on the positive side nowadays, as a way to keep himself balanced.\n\nThough something still bore down on his shoulders. It bore down on him even after the fire was put out. It got heavier as the day went on, and more information was revealed. The fire did not start in the reactor itself, god forbid, but at the workplaces of the engineers. Papers and other materials caught fire, and it spread from there. But that was not all. One distressed worker informed him that the cooling fans had stopped working the day before. Now they were all observing the birthplace of the fire, ash itching at their eyes. A corner of the room and its ceiling was completely burnt into a huge black stain, and the ashy remains of a pile of paper and trash lay scattered on the floor.\n\n"Amateur..." Wahlman muttered under his breath. He could see the scene in his head, playing like a movie. Someone piled all the flammables on a corner and set them alight. The movie became more detailed as they examined further. Stains on the carpet, on papers that did not catch on flame. Cut wires to cause an electrical fire. An amateur arsonist soaked fuel on the floor where it did not properly combust, and the fire at the pile of paper did not catch enough air. Nothing got past the fire-proof doors. Wahlman came out of the room, almost happy. Happy at the arsonist's incompetence, and happy that they'd just given him confirmation of their existence."

Only the orange light of his desklamp accompanied him. His wife had described having trouble finding a perfect Christmas tree, and their daughter was... distressed, to put it lightly. He chuckled, and continued on the report he'd been working on. About the fire that threatened PM-3A. Sometimes he wished he was writing about Christmas trees. Instead, he was listing his and the team's observations. The rumor of a saboteur had spread like wildfire.\n\nOn one hand, Wahlman considered it was nice to not be the only crazed suspicious guy at the workplace anymore. On the other, maybe all this buzz around it would make it harder to catch the culprit. Wahlman tried to put himself on the bastard's boots, sipping his coffee. If he was him, he'd be scurrying out of McMurdo with his tail between his legs. The higher-ups were combing every nook and cranny for the mole, but so far there was nothing. All the while, he considered doing things himself. Maybe set up a trap. Or stand guard every night. Then again, that would make his eye bags even bigger.\n\nHis chest felt heavy. The head technician could be back home right now, worrying about Christmas trees. He could be home. Wahlman grit his teeth and shook his head. He'd be home once the mole messing with his reactor was caught. Too much time had been lost for nothing to turn up. And how long had this been happening for? Over a dozen people had been injured due to radiation so far. Too much damage had been caused."

Wahlman had spent the past month examining every corner and floor tile of the reactor building, hoping to find a place the saboteur could be crawling in from. It was Jeremy who first noticed the window on the backside of the building.\n\n"It's not closing properly," he said, opening it to demonstrate, "It's because of overpainting. Too much paint and it makes the frame thicker. The window doesn't fit anymore."\n\n"Trust me, I worked on this back home. If a mole wants to get in here, this window is their entrance. We should fix it up." But Wahlman raised his hand in objection. "Leave it," he said, adjusting his glasses, "We won't fix it. I have to meet with someone now."\n\nEver since the fire, armed guards had surrounded the reactor. That was until Wahlman requested for them to stand down. It took some convincing, but eventually security agreed to the plan. On that freezing night, the guards would retreat, and open the way for the mole to try and attack McMurdo's lifeline again. Wahlman and Jeremy would be waiting for him.\n\nThe two men sat in the dark, only the brooding growl of the reactor keeping them awake. Jeremy lit a cigarette, and offered it to Wahlman. The head engineer would usually reproach his junior for doing that. But tonight he thanked him, and took a long smoke. "Hey, uh," Jeremy muttered, looking away, "I dunno if there's actually a spy or what not, but this is probably the most interesting thing I've ever done."\n\nHe laughed sheepishly, "Um, thanks for including me, Kenneth." There was quiet for a moment, as Wahlman took a deep breath."

 antarctica_aao_nuclear.120.desc:0 "Wahlman's eyes were heavy. The monotonous humming of PM-3A drowned out his thoughts. The rhythmic thuds of the wind against the building threatened to lull him to sleep. Suddenly, the noise of an object hitting the ground awoke him. A heavy object. He sat upright in his chair, and turned to see Jeremy also on alert. They heard a hushed voice curse from the room ahead of them.\n\nWahlman nodded to his partner, before standing up and briskly approaching the source of the noise. A gun in one hand. A flashlight in the other. The growl of the reactor hid his light steps, but Wahlman still dared not to breathe.\n\nHe heard more hushed cursing. Wahlman's light pierced through the darkness in an instant, illuminating where the voice came from. Caught in the light was a lanky young man, staring at him with wide eyes. He was crouching, one hand grabbing a large gasoline container.\n\n"Oliver," Wahlman said, the air taken out of his lungs. He knew the man's name. Oliver, one of his engineers. For a moment that felt eternal, Wahlman was completely frozen. Jumbled thoughts raced through his head. One of his engineers. How did he not see it? How did he fail like this?\n\nOliver took the opportunity to run. Wahlman tried to raise his gun, but he looked at the young man's face and just couldn't move. The mole ran past him, just as the gates of the reactor building were kicked open. In came a barrage of shouting soldiers, blocking the way and pointing their guns at the traitor. Jeremy had done his part, sounding the alarm. Now all that McMurdo's mole could do was crouch down with raised hands, and surrender."

 antarctica_aao_nuclear.130.t:0 "Icy Interrogation"
 antarctica_aao_nuclear.130.desc:0 "The interrogation room was small. Darkness was held at bay by only one lightbulb, blaring its unforgiving light as Wahlman and Oliver stared at each other. "I did my service to this country," Oliver finally said. His voice shook.\n\nOliver Dunn. White male, twenty-seven years old. From a middle class family, and a resident of Jacksonville, Florida, before deployment to Antarctica. Wahlman reread the profile over and over. No past history of troubling behavior. Oliver was a normal young man. Or at least, that's what you'd think until you saw his possessions. After his arrest his dorm had been sacked. They found smuggled pro-Nazi literature, sensitive maps of McMurdo Station, and most egregiously, a one-way voice link communication device. Wahlman never thought he'd be using his interrogator experience in Antarctica. But here he was. "Why, Oliver?" he said with an even tone, "You could have put many people here in danger. People who trust you." Despite his words, the interrogator's expression was more concerned than angry. This was a calculated choice. Building sympathy.\n\nLight exposed a bright bruise on Oliver's forehead. Whoever had been trying to pry information out of him before hadn't been too kind. "I don't care about any of them, filthy race traitors, mongrels. Judeo-Bolshevik scum all," Oliver spat out. Walhman knew dogma when he heard it, "No one ever gave a shit about me my whole fucking life, least of all you. Nobody cared until I was important. Dangerous. Our nation is weak, ridden with subhumans and Jews. I've seen the light," The young man's breathing grew agitated, his speech becoming jumbled with German, "Only my brothers in the Klan understand the truth of things, enlightened by the racial science of the great Ahnenerbe!"\n\nWahlman stared down. Not only an interrogator, he also spoke German. He'd translated some of the papers Oliver had, enough to get an idea. But this was still confirmation. He clicked his pen and jotted down a single word among his notes. Ahnenerbe."

The sky was black, and the engineer could not see anything past the light coming from the windows behind him.\n\nThe interrogation had lasted hours. Eventually that young man's hateful eyes were too much to bear. He'd left that room only with the assurance that Oliver was a very angry kid. A kid who'd also been in contact with the Ahnenerbe for months, prior to even setting foot on Antarctica. A kid who'd sabotaged the reactor, harming God knows how many people.\n\nWahlman took a puff of smoke, batting one boot against bits of ice. The familiar guilt that had plagued him the past few months once again crawled up his head. He was responsible for the state of the reactor, and he was responsible for his engineers. He'd failed at both things. How had he not seen it?\n\nOne of his own engineers. An American. To make it worse, there were many more like him. Others who could believe the Ahnenerbe's drivel. Some of them could be in McMurdo, just like Oliver. They were scientists, intellectuals, people who were meant to light the torch of progress for humanity. As Wahlman stared into the void, he felt the Ahnenerbe's goal was to lead the torch to much darker, sinister places. What could he do? Was he not a scientist too?\n\n"Hey, Kenneth," Jeremy said. Light washed in as the door opened. Laughter and chatter came from inside. The team was celebrating the capture of the mole. Jeremy held up a bottle of booze, "You wanna join us now? We need our head engineer, y'know." The two men stared at each other for a minute, before going inside together."

 antarctica_aao_nuclear.150.desc:0 "It was a Canadian arctic plane. One of the many that the OAA used for flights into the inner continent. That's how Wahlman recognized them, at least. Though this plane in particular was not operated by Canadians, or really by any conventional forces. It was operated by MACA-SOG, and surrounded by CIA spooks in dark coats and jackets. Neither was it carrying supplies to far flung bases. No, this plane was to carry a prisoner.\n\nWahlman watched from afar as CIA men dragged Oliver Dunn across the ice. The Ahnenerbe agent did not resist, he walked with his head down as the faceless spooks slipped him quietly into the aircraft. Next to Wahlman stood one of the spooks.\n\n"Isn't it just beautiful today?" The agent, who went by McGraw, gazed at the sky. The engineer did not answer. He adjusted his glasses and watched grimly as the plane caught flight, and left McMurdo, heading for the interior. To where, Wahlman didn't know. "You'd think such a calm place would be more peaceful," McGraw spoke up again, sighing, "I suppose someone's gotta protect it, though." With that, the agent in black coat trudged away.\n\nProtect. The word stayed with him as he watched another plane land on the runway. The plane he was supposed to wait for. Bringing yet another team for the reactor. The engineer gave one last look to the dark horizon where Oliver disappeared, and turned away."

He preferred it over drinking anything alcoholic, even if they were on break.\n\nSilently, he reviewed the situation with the reactor. Although the mole was removed, some issues continued. In a perfect world, maybe all of it would be the Ahnenerbe's fault. As he had figured before, though, Antarctica is not friendly to delicate machines like the PM-3A.\n\n"Mr. Wahlman," A tap on his shoulder made him turn, to see one of the new engineers looking up at him, "Me and a couple other guys were coming up with a plan to increase the rate at which we deradiate the contaminated water," he said, "and, well, we were hoping you could look into it?" The young man looked down at his shoes, fiddling with a stack of papers.\n\nAfter taking a sip of his drink, Wahlman sighed. It wasn't news that recently he'd gotten a reputation for being a boss who was, erm, not easy to deal with. That was in the past. It had to be, for the good of the team, and himself. "We can look into it, yes," Wahlman finally answered. New people and new ideas, he thought, would be the key to making this thing work. "Though let's do it after the break."\n\nThe new guy nodded, surprised, and then walked away. Breaks were important. Jeremy had drilled it into his head for months, and eventually Wahlman gave in. He took another sip of cocoa, and looked at the sky. It really was a sunny day. Things seemed sunnier now, that he did not bear the burden alone."

The boxes left behind by the Army engineers were the skeleton of an audacious project, and Raborn had been given the responsibility of seeing it through.\n\nHe knew exactly why this had landed on his desk. A few years ago, Raborn had been given the similar task of rendering the Navy's Polaris missile functional. He had little engineering experience. He proved his worth through effective use of PERT, Project Evaluation and Review Technique, getting the UGM-27 Polaris missile off the ground four years ahead of schedule. Such a feat was rare in military development and unheard of in rocket design. For this achievement, Raborn was promoted to Vice Admiral in 1960.\n\n"Iceman," Raborn mouthed as he scanned the first of thousands of documents. He surmised the Army was looking to create its own niche in the nuclear triad and they wanted his help to see it done as quickly as possible. Given the chaotic state of the project and the secrecy to which he'd been sworn, he knew he had his work cut out for him. Many of the design teams subordinated to him would have to be isolated from each other, kept in the dark. This need-to-know development would be a challenge to work around. Raborn was puzzled at the degree of secrecy, even the Polaris project hadn't necessitated this level of clandestine obfuscation. Of course in a world gone mad, one can never be too careful.\n\nRaborn knew that in due time he would be clued in on the wider goals of Project Iceman, the Army couldn't keep the design team in the dark forever. All that was to be done now was to inform the teams of their responsibilities and manage the project's workflow via PERT.

The slightest change in weight, engine power, or payload capacity might mean the difference between placing a satellite in orbit or sending it to a fiery death in the upper atmosphere. From a military perspective, the choice of launch vehicle was essential in determining the range and destructive capability of a missile, and nowhere was this more true than in the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nVice Admiral Raborn had a decision to make: he had to choose between one of two launch vehicles for Iceman. The first option was the Minuteman I: a reliable, three-stage rocket which utilized cheap solid-rocket fuel and required only a modest silo, very easy to build and maintain. The second option was the Titan II: a two-stage liquid-fueled rocket, much larger than the Minuteman but possessing far greater range and payload capacity.\n\nIt wasn't an easy choice. In polar climates, compact equipment requiring minimal maintenance was generally king, therefore the Minuteman seemed the logical choice. On the other hand, despite the enormous engineering challenges posed by the Titan, the two-stage liquid-fueled rocket was far more flexible in terms of potential targets and warhead yield. Raborn bemoaned the secrecy surrounding the project. If he knew more about the specifics about the missiles' intended purpose, he could make a more informed choice. As it stood, he had to work off very limited data.\n\nHe reduced the issue down to a simple question: did the flexibility offered by the Titan's range outweigh the compact, low-maintenance Minuteman?"

Raborn had previously surmised that it had to be somewhere in the Arctic, with his money being on Alaska. But the design teams didn't even know that much and he had trouble figuring out how to disseminate this new information to them without giving it away.\n\nIn his discussion with the electronics team, he had to gently nudge away from the issue of system cooling. When he spoke to the airframe team, he had to suggest that the rocket would need to be rigged to survive a much wider range of external temperatures than others of its kind. And of course the really fun one, figuring out to tell the re-entry vehicle team that they had to store warheads in a polar climate... without telling the re-entry vehicle team that they had to store warheads in a polar climate.\n\nRaborn made a mental note that if he ever met the dick who came up with this concept of extreme secrecy, he'd be sure to thank and slap him, not necessarily in that order.

Consequently, he'd had to design a variable system that could work as well in Alaska as it did in Iceland, and which could be calibrated right up until launch to adapt to new targets.\n\n"Are we sure it's not too heavy?" Cooper's assistant, Heichert, asked.\n\n"I don't care," Cooper snapped, "I honestly do not care. They've barely given us anything to work off of. If the piece of shit exceeds their lift capacity, it's their problem."\n\n"What if Raborn asks for a redesign?"\n\n"Then tell IBM to give us more information next time. Their MIRV's might be able to work in a vacuum, but we can't.""

 antarctica_aao_pert.60.desc:0 "Vice Admiral Raborn, sequestered in a bunker to the east of the launch site, observed the stacked and fueled missile through a pair of binoculars, wreathed in mist. It was only one tenth the size of what the final vehicle would be, and was nowhere near powerful enough to reach the Kármán line, but it was powerful enough to reach supersonic speed. When designing the frame of any rocket, it was important to learn how the frame would behave when it reached maximum dynamic pressure. If the frame was poorly designed, the rocket would crumple like a tin can. A miniature rocket required only a miniature launch site, and an impromptu one had been assembled a few miles inland from McMurdo.\n\nRaborn had seen many rocket launches. It never got old; the long wait, the building anticipation, the final breathless second before the engines ignited, and the impossible, otherworldly climb into the heavens. His thoughts were soured by the notion that he lived in a world where such incredible machines were used as deterrents, weapons of mass destruction to hold tyrants at bay. He hoped he lived long enough to see a time when rockets were used as tools of peace and exploration. But for now, he had to create the most effective weapon possible.\n\n"We are go for launch," said the launch director over the intercom.\n\nRaborn nodded to himself. The countdown reached zero and a blazing fire lit up the Antarctic snow. The miniature rocket climbed into the sky and beyond sight, a roaring success. Now they could proceed with development on the full sized missile."

On the other side of the glass pane, in a sterilized bay, technicians from IBM were installing Cooper's Inertial Navigation System onto the rocket. A panel on the rocket was open and the INS was being carefully guided in like a transplant organ.\n\n"Not a bad analogy," said Cooper, "although the real surgery was the alteration I had to make to the INS so it could come in under the mass specifications. IBM, unfortunately, makes heavy machines. The interesting thing is, the next generation of rockets won't have this problem."\n\n"How's that?" asked Raborn.\n\n"Well, as we've witnessed in the past two decades, computer hardware continues to grow more compact and lighter in weight while their processing power increases. The next generation of this INS will be half the size and double the power."\n\n"I wish we had it now. It would make our job a lot easier.""

After countless sleepless nights, they were finally mating the re-entry vehicle, which would carry the nuclear payload, to the nose of the launch vehicle. Naturally, there was no plutonium or uranium core inside the REV, but that didn't mean there wouldn't be hell to pay if this didn't work perfectly.\n\nDavidson could feel Vice Admiral Raborn's stern gaze on the back of his neck as the REV team and the launch vehicle team brought the two components another inch closer together. In the moments before the coupling was completed, Davidson began to piece a scattered jigsaw puzzle together in his head. He'd initially thought it lunacy for a rocket development program to take place in Antarctica, but there was a simplistic perfection to the plan: by separating the individual teams and confining them to McMurdo, the chance of a security leak was drastically reduced. The greatest risk, and pain in the ass, came during the transport of the rocket materials to the OAA. Davidson supposed the individual components were shipped down in the guise of habitats and construction equipment, however after that moment of delivery, total secrecy could be assured. All lines of contact with the outside world were rigorously monitored. Simply put, the US Military wasn't taking any chances on this project.\n\nThe REV slid into place perfectly. Davidson exhaled and looked back at Raborn, who gave him a nod and a thumbs-up. Another milestone completed, and not a soul on the outside knew."

Erecting a launch tower and propellant loading system required long stretches of pipeline, the building and maintenance of which would be difficult atop sheets of ice. Fortunately, some of the only places in Antarctica that remained ice-free year round were located inside the OAA.\n\nThe Transantarctic Mountains bisected the continent, and formed a shield for the inhabited coastline where McMurdo was situated. Nestled among those peaks lay dry valleys sheltered from both ice and prying eyes. Vice Admiral Raborn had ordered a team of surveyors to find a valley with dimensions suitable for the construction of rocket infrastructure. As Lead Surveyor Gordon studied the rocky desert below him, he nodded to himself. He shouldered his backpack and began the long descent into the valley, trudging over snow-covered shale.\n\nAs he reached the valley floor, he took in the scale of the mountains, standing in stark relief against the clear sky. It occurred to him that this might be the first time human beings had ever set foot in this particular spot. Its pristine nature almost brought a tear to his eye, along with the realization that Mankind would soon defile it, perverting it with weapons of mass destruction. "This planet will not miss us," he murmured to himself.\n\nAnyway, he wasn't paid to philosophize.

Preliminary calculations showed that there would be less than three percent chance of failure during the test flight, a figure unheard of for the maiden voyage of a rocket. Naturally, the odds of success had a great deal to do with the proven nature of the launch vehicle and its associated systems, but Cooper had to give it to his team, and all the others; they'd essentially created a perfect polar launch vehicle.

The revelation that a rocket was being designed in Antarctica was wild enough, let alone the fact that Reedy had been given the task of transporting said rocket to the launch pad in the middle of the God-damn Transantarctic Mountains without anybody noticing. You couldn't hide an ICBM like a Christmas present; the shape kind of gave the game away. However Reedy was nothing if not resourceful.\n\nIt turned out that some of the straight habitat modules for McMurdo were long and wide enough to hide a missile on its side. After gutting the module of internal compartments and environmental systems, the frame made a pretty good covering. Naturally, the rocket also had to be stripped of anything that could be re-added at the launch site, but even then, it was a tight fit. Tarps had to be draped over the engine assembly and down the sides of the habitat. At a glance, the whole operation could be mistaken for the building of an outpost far from McMurdo, but anyone with half a brain, two eyes, and a minute's analysis would deduce that there was something suspicious about that habitat.\n\nAs an added precaution, Reedy started the convoy around five in the morning, when most of the base was still asleep and the sentries were at the tail end of their shift. They would only see a cloud of snow disappearing into the distance.\n\nAfter a treacherous drive through the mountains along hastily-constructed roads, the missile was finally delivered to the dry valley and the launch pad nestled within."

"Accomplishing all this," said Lee, "with strict specifications and under such time constraints is astounding-"\n\n"Not to mention the clandestine nature of the operation," Lewis cut in with a smirk.\n\nRaborn wasn't smiling as he said, "Perhaps now is the time to bring our allies into the fold?" Without waiting, he gestured to a nearby sergeant and Hillary and Beale were brought into the room. The two men appeared slightly confused, but when they reached the window and saw the rocket, their mouths fell open. And then they rounded on Raborn.\n\n"What's going on here, William?" Beale said as if he suspected the answer.\n\nRaborn quickly explained everything Hillary and Beale was allowed to know, which was much less than what even Raborn had been told. "The missile," said Raborn, "was designed at McMurdo over the past few years, now here it stands."\n\nHillary's face was red. "This is unacceptable, this is... this... you kept us in the dark!"

He was beyond pleased with himself, and he could tell the other team leads were as well. Secretly, he didn't believe they'd succeed.\n\n"Unfortunately I can't reveal the purposes to which your work will be put, other than that your efforts have gone towards protecting the free world from ultimate darkness," Raborn took a deep breath, "I'm sure some of you will be pleased to hear that with the completion of the project you will be relocated stateside or otherwise placed within the OFN to further our technological endeavors. Having said that, I took the liberty of arranging a little surprise."

Heath was keenly aware that he might be replaced over this, through no fault of his own. He'd ordered his team to be compliant and quiet, but the CIA officers had already ordered several of the design staff up against the wall like criminals and sequestered others for interrogation.

We've been instructed not to mark HQ on our maps so that the Songkok's won't know where HQ is if they capture our bodies, but I assure you it's here."\n\n"Thank you so much," Takia said as he and Lefty drew pistols and shot the officer and his men.

It seemed the target was a little slow, and while Lefty couldn't understand Thai, it seemed the guard the target was meant to replace was equally upset about this tardiness. After a heated exchange, the previous guard marched off towards the compound, Lefty for the previous guard to disappear into the darkness before cutting short the target's life with a bullet from a modified S&W 39.\n\nLefty flipped his radio back on and spoke into it, "This is Lefty, target down."\n\nThere was a pause before the radio squawked back, "Copy that, took ya long enough, head to rendezvous."\n\nLefty met with the rest of his team near the edge of a clearing. Past the trees lied a one story concrete building encased in chain link fence and razor wire. Between the fence and the building, a pair of armed guard shared a cigarette. On Lefty's mark the pair were dispatched and six of the ten men team emerged from the forest towards the compound. Wire cutters frantically cut at the chain link and while men were shuffled under into the compound. Once inside the fence, the six advanced to the wall of the prison. Without a word, a soldier prepared the explosives to breach the concrete walls. In just 15 seconds, Abe gave a thumbs up indicating his work was finished. The team backed off along the wall in either direction away from the explosives. As Abe counted down his fingers, the men covered their ears and opened their mouths. The world was shook by Abe's bomb and the wall was forced open. Two men stayed outside to cover the flanks, as the remaining four entered the compound. Inside they found three Thai guard who hastily surrendered, as well as a single large cell filled with 442nd veterans. Lefty peered through the bars and looked over the faces until he saw him."

It is projected that Pro-American candidates will be able to win handily in the coming weeks across the nation.\n\n2) The Malayan electoral system is rudimentary at best, and nonexistent at worst. ATHENS has exploited this fact by creating multiple false ballot votes in remote areas not reached by the official government, and has produced efficient results which has drastically increased the confidence of Pro-American candidates campaigning in the area, pushing momentum in Malaya towards a Pro-American government to be put in place.\n\n3) ATHENS has exploited the Malayan enmity towards Chinese Malays, Japanese, and other minority groups in order to sway aforementioned minorities into voting handily for their respective Pro-American candidates. Multiple contacts have additionally been made with respect to the incredibly small Japanese community which may prove of use to OLYMPUS in future operations here (See Pg. 5.)\n\n4) ATHENS has currently consolidated at £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon £censor_char_texticon  and is currently monitoring the electoral cycle in order to make fine-tuned adjustments in order to ensure that the Pro-American side achieves a reasonable electoral victory as advised via OLYMPUS.

In truth, its original owner created it mostly to take advantage of subsidies... it was never profitable on its own merits. And now that the war was over and many policies overturned, even that purpose was lost.\n\nAbdul wandered about the area... the coffee wasn't terribly healthy. Indeed, many of the plants were dead. There were lots of weeds growing about. There were also various buildings for workers and storage, but they were dilapidated through disuse and there were never many people working there anyways.\n\nIndeed, the original owner was lucky to be able to sell this land to anyone, let alone for the very generous price being offered.\n\nThe location wasn't near anything. The buyer couldn't have been interested in the view, either. There wasn't anything to see for miles... or anything that could see this place for miles. He started to wonder... this would be a perfect spot if someone wanted to do something outside of prying eyes.\n\nWell, it was only a hypothesis, nothing really to bother himself with.

This could be it, sir, our golden opportunity to kick the Nazis down to size."\n\nRip rose, walking over to the window. His eyes consulted the torrents of frigidity, the harsh storm that defined the world. Much like his entire being in contrast with the elements, an ill fitting badge glinted on his chest. It was of the MACA-SOG, Military Assistance Command, Antarctica, Studies and Observations Group. Technically beholden to Antarctic command, technically limited to the Antarctic waters in jurisdiction. All just words, meaningless words.

Holding that cross of Lorraine is an honorable duty. But, bogged down in West Africa, with no hope in sight for purging darkness in the motherland? That is enough to make a man weep, no?"\n\n"That is why the agency has come to you with this offer, Monsieur Bigeard. You and your men's services in return for our money. Washington's pockets are deep. Practically whatever you want." Agent Robertson was predictably composed, save for a gravely pitch that Marcel put down to the strain of a long journey. He was not privy to how the American squinted at him behind his shades.\n\n"No... no no no," the mercenary General shook his finger, "I won't be wheeled in on some mad scheme, ordered by Americans into a death trap, an inferno. Money, that is one thing. Death? Death without point, or purpose? It would be a sad thing to die, Robert, a nameless man. One whom history does not shine on."\n\nRip gave Marcel a long, hard, studying look. Here he was, a man who, without complaint, had become nameless, featureless, fading into an image. A symbol.\n\n"Well..." Rip mused calmly, restraining his annoyance, "If money isn't enough incentive... and I know it isn't exactly conquistador bullion, but the might of America is nothing to sniff at, is it not?

His observer silently pondered if the contrast was greater between the European uniform and the treacherous jungle it could not bend to its will, or the iron uniform with its squirming wearer.\n\nThe man turned around to face his observer, a slight nervous smile of keeping confidence. Warmth and comfort was found within the sight of that shadow, the black suit and glasses of a CIA agent. Perhaps, it had been a while since the man had a silent, patient, listener. There where few priests that Nazi bureaucrats could confess too on Madagascar.\n\n"I now realize I was never meant to rise high, be engrossed in ambition that got me sent to this... place," he spat, "And... I am at peace with that. I have gained clearer understanding. Bartthold Otto! Confidant of America. Asset to your prestigious agency. Loyal defector to the superior side. Thank you... for listening."\n\nThe agent almost flinched at how loud he was talking. Almost. Words were exchanged: codes, plans, secrets. Never the whole picture, just enough for this little man to play the big role he so desired.\n\nDesired. The agent pondered if Otto spoke a word of truth. Self interest motivated his actions that led to exile in all but name, and now he took the winning side. In the end, so long as he did as he was told, it mattered little if Otto was loyal."

Tiredness and night swallowed up the revolutionary passions and fires. They belonged to the day. Here and now, rain churned up and made malleable the fiercest surface, and darkness crept into a man's world, taking it all, bit by bit.\n\nThe faint sound of footsteps were barely audible to the guards, as they broke up weakened mounds of dirt. It was the black outline they saw approaching. It was a sight that agreed with them. One they had expected. With quiet grins and restrained joviality, they patted the stiffly standing shadow on the back, and let it in.\n\nThe shadow woke no one and nothing. The sound of feet landing in puddles was masked by the very rain that created it. To the eyes of anyone or thing that cared to look, the shadow was like any other thing, going about its private little life, indistinguishable from a napping man or rat in the trash.\n\nThe shadow entered, reluctantly lowering its drenched hood, revealing the American agent beneath. He planted a suitcase on top of a desk. Behind it sat a militiaman like any other, and behind him still the red-white-green Republican flag. In truth, its real colors should have been red white and blue.\n\n"I hope you did not get too wet, on your journey," the asset said, eyeing up the cash, "We are at the disposal of your agency.""

Neglect or malice had wiped out other settlements in the last 20 years, they were lucky to have only lost some to disease and to the Vichy French plantations. Life went on, subsistence fishing continued, as did the planting season, all while children and the sound of accordions resounded through the thick air.\n\nBut the elders knew better. Their mind sang a darker song of the inevitability of their oppressors return. No matter what ethos or flag it came draped in, eventually a firm boot would be placed once again on their throats.\n\nAnd they were right, that day a French flag marked with the cross of Lorraine was visible on the horizon. Without preparation or consideration, the village was rounded up. Men, women, and children screamed and pleaded. They were marched hundreds of miles to a replacement village deeper in OFN territory, away from the reach of the CPS or Pakt. Many would die, the old, the hungry, the grieving.\n\nThose away planting or fishing, when they returned to the husk of a home, did not linger. The crocodiles would be revered and fed Zebu no more. The lemurs' screams and warnings of predators fell silent and unheeded. Now they watched, silent, idle. The new village would not be the same, for the inseparable people had been broken.

Plus, the longer he spent away, the more worried he got about what was going on 'back home'.\n\nStill, Antarctica was not an island. A Nazi victory here would only embolden them, and ultimately threaten the OAA itself. Besides, he figured it was probably good for him to have a change of pace.\n\nThe Malagasies held their weapons awkwardly. These were not the hardened mercenaries he was used to directing, but you fight with the army you have. One of them seemed frustrated as he kept missing his target. McGraw shouted to him, "You're jerking the trigger!" in a direct, firm tone. More quietly he said, "Don't let the recoil surprise you, just squeeze the trigger." To another, he grilled them, "Do not keep your finger on the trigger! You'll do the German's job for them!"\n\nMore drills went on through the day. Bayonet training, communications, marching. The Malagasies were progressing rapidly, if nothing else. They were enthusiastic, too. That was unsurprising, he'd seen what the Nazis were doing to countries like these.\n\nIt wouldn't be much longer before they were about to see combat. McGraw was, of course, nervous.

It would have been easier to speak German, she knew that before coming, but speaking their language made her more approachable. It showed that they were different from the Nazis.\n\nShe had been a medic in the navy before being approached by the CIA. Pay was a lot better, and well, who didn't want to be a spy? She'd heard tales all her life about the exploits of her forebears in the last war, and this was the closest thing she could get.\n\nShe had some concerns about Rip, what little she had heard of him. But she couldn't complain, they were doing good work here in Madagascar. Mosquitoes, with the diseases they carry, were the animal that killed the most people. Most would be surprised to learn that, but anyone spending any time in Madagascar knew it to be true.\n\nOf course, there was a wire on her and a recorder, and she was taking notes, cleverly disguised as the scratchings of a seasoned doctor. But the medical help was real, at least.\n\nThe child recoiled a bit from the needle. She whispered, "It's ok, it will just be a pinch and it's over... and there's a lollipop for you afterwards. Can you be brave for me?" The child nodded, and she put the needle in his arm.\n\nShe had watched and listened carefully for any info on enemy troop movements, but little information was gleaned. It had been like this a while. Perhaps this whole operation was achieving nothing.\n\nThough, as she handed the lollipop to the child, who ran into the arms of his grateful parents... she realized that wasn't true."

Operation Foreign Patriot, as he dubbed it, would include false-flag attacks behind the Japanese lines, disrupting trade, funding terrorist attacks from the Communists...\n\nThe plan to destabilize the collaborators was very well documented, but still raised a question, which Lynch voiced to his superior, "Aren't the Philippines outside of our zone of operations?"\n\nRip was quick to answer this, his hand pointing to the isles on the world map, "We're assigned to the Indian Ocean, Grayston, and the Philippines could be considered the easternmost part of the ocean. When I was in Malaya, no one said anything, right? Well, the Philippines are just a frog jump away from it."\n\nIf the answer didn't satisfy Lynch, he didn't show it and instead reached for a sketch lying under a pile of cardboard folders, "So, bombing Batangas City's port, huh?

One way was through the remnants of the US Forces in the Philippines, which could certainly use some support in their efforts to seize control of the south.\n\nAnother avenue was to sabotage the weak and increasingly halfhearted KALIBAPI government as it struggled through the vicissitudes of governance.\n\nRobertson and the MACA-SOG felt both were worth pursuing. Their mission aimed to do just that.\n\nAs the plane touched down, the two CIA men reached for their hip flasks and took a deep swig.

But it wasn't like he would care. We're fighting a war, and we're trying to win it, said Rip. Down with the bureaucrats! He couldn't have agreed more.\n\nAnd there he was, ready to take off in a small helicopter that would fly him to one of the AFRSR's secret bases, in a meeting no one would have ever allowed in the CIA. Allying with the Reds was against the official foreign policy the CIA had laid down, fearing such an ideology would soon take over the rest of the world. In a sense, they were right, Morgan thought, yet war makes strange bedfellows, and Rip thought it was better to keep an eye on the Reds and help 'em do some damage in the Japanese rear while they were at it.\n\nThe flight wasn't very long, from one of Rip's airstrips he retained in Australia. His helicopter didn't have much range, but it was not a problem: he could always fly to the USFIP and tell some lie to explain what he was doing there.\n\nWhen the helicopter touched the ground, somewhere amidst the thick layers of the jungle, Morgan knew he was under suspicious scrutiny: no one trusted him, and he didn't trust any of the Commies either.

Had the Kenpeitai or other agencies been able to check more closely they might have realized that some of the 'fishermen' were closer to American special services than they would have liked. They might have heard that as things were thrown from one boat to the other in the usual fishing nets and bags there were metallic noises as they dropped to the hull. They might have even heard the scattered English that sounded out across the water.\n\nThe Kenpeitai, however, were off trying to hold Japan's ill-gotten gains together someplace else; moreover, the KALIBAPI navy was off engaging in "joint CPS exercises."\n\nSo deliveries of guns and ammunition to the USFIP and even the HUKBALAHAP continued in this manner, without notice or answer from the forces of the CPS."

At least a communist wouldn't slaughter you for failing to bow down enough times before the God Emperor Hitler Mussolini.\n\nA communist might distrust people like Rip, he was a CIA agent; things like the MACA-SOG were the same as SIDE and PIDE and DOI-CODI to them, that is, capitalist. But the Malaysians, Indonesians, Vietnamese, and Chinese reds on the boat were at least sensible enough to know that he could be relied upon to help them help the Huks (and help Rip by extension).\n\nSo Rip, having no real choice nor any good incentive to object, simply gave them guns and set sail on his fishing vessel.

The Dark Continent is full of people that are ready to help us, if we can pay. French, British, Belgians... Here is the full report I wrote with details attached. To give you a brief summary, the main group we can rely on at the moment is Capricorn, made up of British soldiers and adventurers.

They are ready to fight Clifford Dupont's collaborators, but are not willing to give up the principles of minority rule.

More likely it was the fact that it was rough, broken terrain of a sort that Capricorn's lot found rather easy to maneuver in. The Ostafrikans being used to flatlands and coasts, could not possibly hope to support their fellow Nazis.\n\nGaining the upper hand, it was not long before the Nazi scum surrendered. Obviously, they were expecting to be coddled, perhaps handed over to the South African government and ransomed, or better yet sent to America to parasitize off the Land of the Free. Capricorn had other plans; the prisoners' derisive cries became panicked pleas for mercy as they were lined up at the edge of a ditch.\n\nMorals, humane sentiments, and the Geneva Convention mattered nothing to Griggs as he contacted Grayston Lynch on the radio.

Not content to sit around and allow Germans to dictate to them without anything in return they had formed mercenary outfits.\n\nThe men were willing to sign on to the MACA-SOG's little project once they had ascertained who Grayston Lynch really was, but they had some, as it were, reservations.\n\n"We don't like this little guarantee your government has made, all this talk about 'majority rule' and 'self-determination'. If there's one thing out of anything the Nazis have done here we can agree with it's that they keep those blacks well away from power. If we do do away with them, we're not about to accept blacks taking over the resulting vacuum."\n\nLynch had been expecting this, and had kept his own views, which could, after all, endanger the success of the MACA-SOG operation, compartmentalized away well in advance of the meeting. It was very easy, therefore, for him to simply say, "You needn't worry, gentlemen. Whatever they say to Congress is nothing compared to the reality here.

It was never a slow day.\n\nJohan picked a briefcase. There were plenty coming in that day, but something felt different about this one. It was a rather nice briefcase, black with silver latches on it. There was a small card attached to it, indicating it was from one "Curtis Isaac Anderson". He took his time stamp, quickly checked to make sure it was the correct date, and then stamped a piece of paper, before taping it to the briefcase. He then took it to his boss, Mr. Zondi.\n\nZondi looked at the briefcase and opened up the latches. There were many documents inside containing financial information about various local businesses. He began to jot down the information when his eyes started to widen. The businesses listed here were making a massive return on investments, an almost unbelievable amount especially given the war that had just taken place.\n\nHe considered, for a moment checking for foul play... but there was so much mail going in and so much work to be done.

To that end, they had hired mercenaries and gone head-first into a very controversial war.\n\nTheir methods had been... straightforward, lacking the precision or careful planning that he would have liked. It was for the greater good, Lynch reminded himself. Fascism must be stopped. A man may have to get his hands dirty to oppose tyranny... but one's hands are not any cleaner by allowing it to go unchecked.\n\nBut did Rip have to create so much paperwork for him!? Especially when he was in Antarctica? He would have to redact and sanitize much of these reports. He'd have to go through each of these papers with a redaction pen for any dangerous information. He'd then have to copy each one. Then shred the original. Mostly by himself.\n\nHe sighed, resigned to his fate. The truth was that paperwork was a very big part of the job, working for The Company. Well, at least it paid well. And sure, Rip might have screwed him a bit, but... The Company looked after its own.\n\nLynch's thick black ink redacted line after line, action after action, death after death. It was as if it had never happened at all.

They just shared in the grief of defeat, and traded the few good stories they had been able to make amidst the African hellscape. No point throwing barbs now, not when there was still so much work to get done.\n\nIn the end, Lynch took Griggs to his next ride, a fishing boat. Griggs and Capricorn were ill-inclined to give in just because South Africa had been smashed to pieces; they still had the will to carry on in them, so it went without saying that the Capricorn man would get smuggled back into German Afrika to fight on.\n\nAs Lynch discretely moved on to his next assignment, he wondered what would happen to Griggs.

Jokes, even funny ones, were thrown around like hand grenades. And the drinks and snacks were gulped down, the latter far more than the former, for Grayston Lynch had a bus coming for him.\n\nThe bus came, and Lynch stood up slightly unsteadily. To the cheers of the mercenaries and soldiers he saluted his by-now friend Griggs then boarded the bus, with a hand out of the window as he faded from sight heading towards Quelimane.\n\nGriggs turned aside after a few minutes, then immediately fell over, his head spinning.

Instead hoping the silent trek would terminate soon.\n\nEventually, the agent calmly ordered Simon into a discreet room in a quiet corner of the Station. Stepping inside, the room was cozy, hazy cigarette smoke bouncing off the wood-paneled walls. There were two loungers in the room, and the man inside gestured him forward.\n\n"I managed to snag some donuts from the cafeteria, help yourself."

He grimaced at the thought of the celebrations that were springing up around the world. Making sure no one else was in the area, he switched on his radio. It took many minutes to get the antennae perfectly situated. Once he was finished with that, he carefully tuned into 104.5 McMurdo FM. Immediately, he regretted his decision.

His thoughts were again interrupted by the radio, "I was having a goood day before this, and now it's a good evening, McMurdo Station, Hitler is DEAD!!!"\n\nSwearing, Joachim shut off the radio. All that awaited him was silence. It was deafeningly silent in Neuschwabenland. He envied the man behind the radio station. Even if he was of a lower race, they obviously had friends in that radio station of his. It was probably warm too... Joachim was alone here, and he had been receiving concerning letters from home. His parents and Joachim's Fräulein retreated to their summer home in Alsace. Whatever was about to go down, they wanted to be high in the mountains, away from other people.

Doing his best to savor the wink of rest he caught. Yawning, he switched on the microphone, "Wow, that's a lot of callers! Some of you must be burning the midnight oil. Line one, you are live!" The line opened to a string of German profanity, followed by a,\n\n"WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?! THROWING A PARTY AFTER THE FUHRER PASSED AWAY?!"\n\n"Woahhh, can I get a name and where you're calling from, for the lovely audience-" Simon found himself cut off, "Fuck you, you motherfucker." Simon, indifferent to the profanity, sighed, "Okay bud, I still don't have your name, I can assume you're calling from New Swabia."\n\nEvidently, Simon seemed to have taken the German off guard, "Huh... yeah," Unfortunately, his tactics wore off quickly, "You think you're safe, you read the news and think you're winning. But this... this is just growing pains. Whatever emerges at the end of this-"\n\nSimon hung up the line as the German descended into rambling. "I never got his name, damn shame, that," He quickly composed himself."

Simon responded. He used his radio voice, and the German responded, he didn't sound so great.\n\n"Ah, could be better. I'm talking on the phone with an untermensch after all," He chuckled, and so did Simon.\n\n"Sorry to hear that. We know about as much as you do when it comes to your homeland. Maybe it's for the better," Simon remarked, "So, what brings you to McMurdo FM?"\n\nJoachim looked around at his empty station, the skeleton crew was a bunch of early sleepers. He often found himself up late, free to do as he pleased. That included listening to McMurdo FM more often than he used to. "How do you say it... curiosity killed the cat. Tell me about yourself, I've never met a Polish, American, or Jew."\n\nTaken aback by the vulnerability this German was showing, Simon decided to indulge him, "Well, my name is Simon Paskiewicz, I was raised in Fair Lawn. It's a small town in New Jersey, Before I joined the military I worked in this Nabisco factory. They make sweets. There is this huge soccer field, football for you guys. After work, we would play a round or two. As for my parents, well, we had family in America. They had been here for centuries. So they sponsored my parent's immigration. It was really tough to immigrate to the US back in the 30s. I've never met any of my Polish cousins, the ones that didn't leave."\n\nThe German leaned back in his chair, "I'm glad you made it, American. I lost my dad in Operation Barbarossa, I know how it feels."\n\n"I guess we've got that in common. Isn't that something?" Simon questioned."

So the sharp German accent blaring over the radio came as a surprise to the intrepid explorer.\n\n"Oh! How's our favorite New Swabian?" Edmund, already shocked, was now perplexed that the radio operator had become familiar with this man. Curious, he leaned back in his office chair and listened intently.\n\n"To be frank, not so good. This might be the last time I call you," Shouting could be heard in the background. The scraping of numerous heavy objects across the floor pierced into the phone call. Something was happening.\n\n"Shit... what's going on?" Simon had a fleck of concern in his voice.\n\n"We don't know. One of our guys that went out to piss and never came back... We've heard similar things all across Neuschwabenland. Something... or someone cut the power, we're barricading ourselves in. Listen, Simon, I know I'm supposed to hate you. I know you definitely hate me... but, I hope you make it," As abruptly as he entered, the German was gone.\n\nThe music returned shortly afterward.

I mean, no autonomy, you get drafted, and die in the desert, alone." Simon nodded, he knew Matt was turning the conversation grim for a reason, "It's tragic. Everyone in the OAA volunteered to be here. Not too sure about our neighbors." Taika, who was listening up to this point, finally entered the conversational fray, "I'll tell you what, though, it's gonna create a lot of stories for people to tell."\n\n"You and your stories, Taika. You're always regaling us with that story about your dad hiding in New Guinea for 6 months before catching a trawler to Sydney." Simon remarked, and Taika shrugged in response, "What can I say, it's a story for the ages. Just look at Admiral Raborn, escaping Iwo Jima with duct tape and prayers! I wonder how it feels to have your life hang in the balance like that!"\n\n"Look around, Taika. We're in Antarctica, the coldest front of this cold war. We've seen the Aurora Australis. We've got the patches, and, with the way this world is headed. We'll see enough things to write a book by the time our tour of duty is over." Simon's contemplation was contrasted by Matt's bluntness, "That's if we live to tell the tale, that is."\n\nSimon, ever the optimist, had a quick reply, "Now that I think about it, we wouldn't be here if our parents didn't get lucky. Your parents fled Chongqing, my parents fled Poland. They left behind friends, families, and cousins, they're all dead now. We're the descendants of the lucky ones.""

Now, as for why I'm here today? I'm a proud Dominican American and I'm here to tell you about the things going on in my homeland," Simon took a step back and flashed a thumbs up at guest, the floor was his.\n\n"Well, it's probably been relegated to the back pages, but an invasion of the Dominican Republic is underway. For the past 30 years, it has been a Republic in name only. Rafael Trujillo, the current dictator, has spent his time pursuing a policy of Blanqueamiento. Inviting Iberians to immigrate, while also kicking out darker skinned people. In fact, to give you an idea of how bad it was. Blanqueamiento is the reason why my parents barely bat an eye when they are harassed, because they lived through worse back home," Ritchie stared at his piece of paper, glancing at the bullet points, "Which brings us to the current state of affairs. Trujillo relied on the Iberian Union to provide economic assistance. However, the collapse of the Triumvurate has forced Iberia to turn inwards and contend with domestic issues. Leaving Trujillo out in the open, with a very, very pissed off United States," Ritchie took a deep breath, "That brings us to the Caribbean Legion, made up of Dominican exiles in America. Now, that's the long and short of it. My friend Simon here will keep you updated, and, with any luck, we'll be partying like it's New Years.""

Popping a Newport into her mouth, she lit it up and felt the tension melting away as the buzz took over.\n\nHer tranquil moment of silence was interrupted by the phone ringing.

I'm just... very stressed out."\n\nBack in Antarctica, Ritchie smiled. Clearly, she hadn't heard the news, "I have to go, I only wanted to pop in to tell you to turn on the news. You're gonna like it, trust me."\n\nOnce again, there was silence. Gabriela wished her son well and hung up the phone. Then, she took her dinner out of the microwave.

However, his cousin Samuel was shipping out to South Africa. Simon remembered arguing with his cousin who enlisted in the Marine Corps, "You're always the first to go into battle!" He argued, "I know, which is why I'm joining," Samuel retorted.

A state of war exists between South Africa and its neighbors, this is a blatant attempt by the Afrika-Schild to wipe out democracy in Africa." Matt sighed, he knew this already. What he really wanted to know was if his high school sweetheart, Lizzy, was safe. He still thought about her on cold nights. She was his first kiss, his first time. Despite coming from an infamously racist country, she never cared that he was Asian.

Eventually, they came upon the town church. The two settled on the church's steps, and Matthew pulled smokes out of his breast pocket.\n\n"Pass me one, Matty," Lizzy requested. Together, they lit up their cigarettes. As the zippo ignited, so did their conversation, "I thought about you, watched the news every day to see if they pushed into Vosberg.

We are lucky to be alive, let's seize our happy ending while we can," Matthew glanced at the graveyard, as did Lizzy. "Every man went off to war, five never came back..." Lizzie's voice trailed off as it donned on her. She was lucky. It would take time, but her parents would approve. Especially so once she had children.

Sighing, Taika grabbed his jacket and stormed off into the Deep Freeze. He was going to sleep it off, and reconcile in the morning.\n\nAs morning rose over McMurdo Station, the radio crew silently stewed about in the shack. Silently making their cups of tea and coffee. There was pregnant silence for twelve minutes until Simon spoke up, "Taika..."\n\n"No need to say it, Simon. We weren't in the right headspace last night."\n\n"Yeah... I've been thinking, that maybe there is a silver lining to this all. The Africans... a few of them at least, are the masters of their own destiny now. That's gotta count for something."\n\nMatthew, silently savoring the bold flavors of his black tea, nodded, "Let's just move on, what we've got here is more important than some fucking war that affects none of us."\n\nTaika nodded, glad that cooler heads prevailed, and their friendship persevered."

On the messy tableau were coffee stains, crumbs, and folders of useless crap yet to be sorted. However, one pristine letter stood out. It was Matthew's brother, Tommy, already on the ground in Madagascar. Every day was anxiety-inducing, worrying he might get... that call.\n\n"My brother is one of the troops fighting in Madagascar.

They dug a piece of General Motors shrapnel out of my damn leg. Oh yeah, and check this out, a bullet whizzed by my ear! I thought I was dead until I woke up. I was real bummed because I thought heaven was in Madagascar!" Turning his head, he showed a scar that was a testament to Tommy's luck. He then took a sip of water.\n\n"It's been a while, I love it there, but I'm glad to get some leave from bloody Antarctica." Matt flashed a flask of whiskey to his brother, who simply grinned.\n\n"How is it over there? I heard you made some friends at your little radio station." Tommy looked in the hallway. With Matt on the lookout, he took a swig of whiskey.\n\n"It's a unique experience. I get to tell people I've been to Antarctica! We are doing great. When we aren't sitting in the radio shack we play football in the freezing cold. Oh, and we've got plenty of tea too. One of the Americans I work with, Simon, we managed to get him to start liking tea." Matt enthusiastically regaled Tommy with tales of the frozen frontier.

The year was 1949, and Matthew was only five years old. Thomas was nine, and Jimmy fell in the middle at seven. Their parents were far ahead of them, giving the brothers their privacy to let kids be kids.\n\n"Tommy," Matt looked up at his brother, "What is it?" Thomas said, irritated at Matt interrupting the tranquility. "Why do Mum and Dad go hiking so much?" Matt huffed and puffed, his smaller stature making it a struggle to keep up.\n\nTommy thought about his answer. Despite his young age, he knew why his parents liked the quiet so much. He overheard their nightmares about Chongqing on most nights. Being the oldest brother, he had a duty to keep them oblivious and tell stories. His tales were enough to get Jimmy and Matt back to sleep, "Mum and Dad lived in Chongqing, it was a very loud city... That's why they like the quiet so much." Tommy held Matt's hand, making sure he didn't fall behind. "But Perth is so loud! Miss Henderson's cat keeps me awake," Matt retorted.\n\n"Chongqing was like a million of Miss Henderson's cats meowing at once. Imagine that!" Tommy, seeing that Matt was failing to keep up, scooped him up and placed his brother on his shoulders. The three talked all the way up until they reached the Golden View lookout. From Tommy's point of view, it was very pretty, but for Matthew, still hoisted on Tommy's shoulders, it was magnificent.\n\n13 years later, Thomas Cho looked up at the sky, riddled with bullets, lost in Madagascar, and bleeding out fast. He hoped his family wouldn't miss him too much. His mind settled on that hike in Mundaring, he could even feel Matt's weight on his shoulders."

Standing up, he poured himself a drink and turned out the lights in his office. Then, he returned to his office chair and flicked on the radio. It was Raborn's favorite time of day, a time to listen to music and stare out the window as the sun set over the Ross Sea.\n\nSong after song played on the radio, and the stresses of administrative work unwound with every sip. Those were problems for tomorrow, for now, he was an Admiral sailing on smooth waters. Eventually, the song made way to silence... followed by the familiar jingle of the American Forces Antarctic Network.\n\n"American Forces Radioooooooo." The jingle faded, making way for an Australian voice that was easy on the ears.\n\n"Good evening, this is Matthew Cho, I will be your host for the evening. We're gonna start the evening off with some amazing news. Miracles happen, folks, my brother over in Madagascar was MIA for two months and just last night he was found without a scratch on him. I had already come to terms that we'd never find him. Goes to show that it's not over until it's over. In related news, the Organization of Free Nations has declared victory in Madagascar, establishing a Mandate to guide the newborn nation into..."\n\nAdmiral Raborn's mind drifted upon hearing the good news that befell the radio operator. He thought back to his command on the USS Hancock. 2500 souls sailed out of Iwo Jima on the Hancock. Many lost their sons and fathers that day. No doubt, scared mothers read the newspapers, awaiting the telegram telling them their loved one was KIA. No such telegram would arrive for the families of the Marines, Sailors, and Airmen crammed into the hold."

He deserted from the Army to warn us of what was coming. We had no idea how much danger we were in... they didn't want refugees clogging the highway," Matt's father, Xiao explained, his voice trembled, and he excused himself from the room.

Tommy was only a baby at the time, so I carried him, and your dad took the family rifle and enough food to last us a while."\n\nXiao, now composed, returned to the room, "We drove for hours, and when the sun set, the bombing began. It was never-ending. We had a good head start against the Japanese, though. I'm not proud to say it, but we looted and robbed our way to Kunming. Things hadn't completely gone to shit over there." Shaking her head, Liu tried to brush over their trek to Kunming, "We pawned off our car to some fool who thought he was getting one over on us, and used that cash to bribe our way onto a train going to Thailand. It wasn't until we made it to Chiang Mai that we heard what happened. It was like Chongqing had never existed in the first place, our friends, our families, everything we knew was gone."\n\nMatt had trouble processing this, the idea that they had robbed, looted... maybe even killed people to stay alive. It didn't sit right with him. His parents saw the look on Matthew's face, and they hung their heads in shame, "Matt, we're telling you this because there are going to be Filipinos that come here with nothing, they will beg on the streets, might even mug you.

He huffed, maybe having expected to catch them by surprise. But all that stomping towards the door gave him away. And he continued stomping as he made his way toward the tallest soldier in the room.\n\nPrivate Edward Freeman held his head high, his eyes straight to the front. His CO scanned his rifle for whatever imperfection he could find. When there was nothing, he grumbled under his breath, "Good 'nough for one of your kind." It was just loud enough for Edward to hear, but he didn't say anything. The private's face stayed blank as the CO drove his gaze to the bayonet. The officer probed it for the slightest smudge.\n\nAfter a moment of silent tension, the CO barked out, "Private Edward, your bayonet is dull! Your 24-hour pass is revoked." Red in the face, he moved to another victim. All the while, Edward did not move or react. A balloon of anger itched to burst in his chest, but he didn't let it. It never ended well, he told himself. It never made it better.\n\n"Gentlemen who have been granted passes may leave. The rest stay here," their CO declared, and a good chunk of the company ran off. Edward was amongst those who stayed. He stood near the same spot he had been at during inspection, overhearing two other men complaining, "That bastard is gonna wind up dead somehow, someway," one whispered. The other scoffed, "You watch, he'll probably get promoted. By then I'll be out of this, even if I have to take that offer for Greenland."\n\nAn offer? To get out? Edward appeared between the two soldiers, startling them. He was never good with conversation. Either too dry or too convoluted. But one of the soldiers got it quickly, and nodded, "Yeah, somethin' up in Greenland. Infrastructure, they say. Pretty dull." Dull was enough for Edward.

The rest of the world might as well not exist past those leaves.\n\n"Private Freeman... Are you sure this would be the right job for you?" The recruitment officer set the papers on his desk, and looked at him with what Edward thought was an odd form of concern. "Yes sir," he responded, plainly. Maybe not with enough enthusiasm, he had trouble with that. But not for a lack of trying. It turned out this Greenland gig had a few more positives to it, other than escaping his commander. First and foremost, some extra pay. His face had lit up when he found out. Ma was having enough trouble with bills, she could use the help. Helping Ma was the reason he'd gotten into this whole army circus in the first place, wasn't it?\n\n"I don't know..." The recruiter clicked his tongue, "It's cold up there. Colder than anything here. Are you sure someone of your... erm, origin... could handle it?" Edward did not answer. He might have a few years ago, but not now. He kept imagining the fat roll of cash he'd send to Ma after he got the job. After a moment, he shrugged his shoulders, "Well I just figured, sir. Haven't seen many white boys signing up to go there.

A great white carpet rolled past the horizon on one side, mountains and icebergs glistening under the sun. On the other, a deep blue ocean surrounded white and gray islands. The landscape was all that Edward could pay attention to as they stumbled out of the plane. They had landed at Thule Air Base, in a remote far corner of Greenland.\n\nA long gravel airstrip led them to small buildings huddled around the ice. The base was small, but it wasn't quiet. Personnel flooded the area as Edward and the others were shuffled into the camp. They weren't given a tour, or received by a welcome committee. Instead they were briskly shuffled through rows of checkpoints and security screenings.\n\nEdward stood nervously against suspicious eyes. They were all too similar to the stares cops would give back home. They patted him down, and asked multiple questions. He waited for them to ask for his birth certificate too.\n\n"Alright," said a bored-looking officer, handing him back his papers, "Next." Edward almost expected to be led to another interrogation, but instead he found himself outside. Rows of buses awaited. Buses with blacked out windows.\n\nWhat the hell were they requiring so much security for? Infrastructure? Questions spun around Edward's head, but he stayed quiet. He was good at that.

He walked a little funny as they stepped out into a new camp. The Army told them it was a grand facility dedicated to the "advancement of scientific research." All that Edward could see as they approached the area were rows of huts and small buildings, scattered vehicle tracks, and a lot of soldiers. Soldiers with faces as cold as the air around them, who led them through snow trenches and tunnels in the ice. The camp was much larger underground.\n\nAll led to a tiny conference building near the middle of the camp. Edward stood amongst a mass of other young men, all relieved to be out of the cold. He watched as two officers took to the stage. They introduced themselves as Colonel John C. H. Lee and Major Bennett L. Lewis. And their camp was Camp Century.\n\nThe two men were the head engineers of the project. The briefing was short and honest, which Edward appreciated. They'd be digging tunnels. That was about it. It was the most information he'd been given on this job since volunteering. Why did they need tunnels in the middle of nowhere? Why the security? Edward thought they were good questions, but asking them out loud was a different deal completely.\n\nAs they planted their shovels into the rough and hard ice, Edward felt a little relief. Camp Century was far away, but it seemed it would work the same way home worked. He would be quiet, and not get into trouble. Quietly surviving. Ma would be getting that money sent her way very soon."

 antarctica_aao_greenland.50.desc:0 "A sharp sound pierced through Edward's head as he worked. He grumbled under his breath, imagining this icy field would be pretty peaceful if they weren't working here. A couple yards away was a snow tractor with a powered auger mounted on it. It was in the midst of drilling through the ice, making a deep clean hole. There were other large tractors and sleds plowing through the field. Heated drills melted the thickest areas. Steel machines unbothered by the environment.\n\nHe finished, climbing out of one of the tunnels. They worked on it for the past week. It felt as if he was building a highway back home. Except in the middle of nowhere. What was the point? Cold howling wind bit his face as he walked. It was hard to see and breathe. The workers weren't like the machines. He knew by experience. Then he heard a thud behind him. He saw a fellow worker fallen at the gates of the tunnel and rushed over.\n\n"Thank you, I just slipped," the dazed man muttered as he helped him up. "C'mon," Edward said, "It's our break now." They both walked back to a tiny hut on the outskirts of camp. They were given hot drinks and food. Entering a warm room always felt like walking into heaven. Breaks were mandated. Too much time outside and frostbite would take their fingers and toes.\n\nEdward sat away in a corner, he munched at a sandwich and tried to ignore the wind battering the thin walls. The radio spoke of bad weather for the next few days. Music came on, and Edward was glad. There was little contact with the outside world, with how strict secrecy was.\n\nWhat did they need to hide in building tunnels anyway? Endless tunnels. Testing Arctic construction techniques, they said. But while he didn't ask questions, Edward observed. Officers talked in hushed voices with each other, they planned and hid secrets like the holes in the ground meant more than just drilling practice."

His voice grew quieter, and he kept glancing at the guard standing rigid by the door. Monitored calls were a bit more awkward than he expected.\n\n"I'm sorry Eddie I'm just, uh, well I'm just really glad you're okay. Things back here have been messy, y'know?" Her tone softened. Edward could imagine her face right now. Things were always "messy" back home. Nevermind the protests or the police, sometimes they had to worry about finding dinner. And yet Ma seemed to never falter. Edward didn't feel he could ever be as strong. "Yeah, I know, Ma. I know," he said, "Say, has the money I sent reached you?"\n\nBefore she could answer, he heard the phone snatched, "Eddieeee! It's me, Connie!" his little sister's voice blared on the phone. She announced herself as if he couldn't recognize her. "Hey, sis," he answered, and hid his disappointment. He really wanted to know if the money helped. All he got was Ma shouting in the background as his sister recounted her day to him. Edward rolled his eyes. His sister and Ma weren't very different. They're both talkative. But he liked to listen. It almost felt like home.\n\n"Wait, Connie, where's Anais? Did she pass? Has she graduated yet?" Edward asked as a joke. His other younger sister, Anais, was smarter than anyone he knew. Of course she graduated. Ma took the phone, "Anais is at a protest," she said. Edward gulped. Protests were dangerous, "Ah, alright."\n\nSilence hung between them, "Eddie, she's okay. She's gonna be okay," Edward tried to listen to her reassurance. The officer at the door gave him a sympathetic look, tapping his watch. Time was up."

On the way he saw two men fixing up some of the flickering lights on the frozen ceiling. A ceiling which was much too low for Edward's comfort. He was sure some of the guys he played basketball with back home wouldn't be able to fit in this damn thing.\n\nWhen they came out, they were met by a surprising sight. High in the sky, the sun was peeking between two large clouds. The field of snow glistened bright under the light. These past winter months had been the longest time Edward had spent without seeing the sun, the sky stuck in an eerie twilight. Suddenly, it was back.\n\nHis comrades too watched in awe, before a large snow tractor plowed the road in front of them. Colonel John and Major Bennett, who Edward remembered as the brains behind this whole project, were aboard the vehicle. They were also looking at the sky, before turning to see the field, and all they were leading. Edward watched the tractor head up a hill, heading for the next set of tunnels. They were expanding southward. As they watched, an officer walked over to his group.\n\n"Good job to everyone," the officer greeted them. "Come back to the hut, they got you some hot cocoa prepared." All the men cheered for a job well done, and Edward himself walked back with them with a slight smile. That tunnel was finished. He felt a strange sense of satisfaction about that, and he even got bold enough to talk to some of his fellow soldiers for the first time. Everyone seemed in an open and good mood.\n\nA victory was a victory, Edward reasoned, as he looked at the sun. Still, he wondered, what kind of job had they actually accomplished?"

 antarctica_aao_greenland.80.desc:0 "Beams of warm golden sunlight seeped through the foliage of an old maple tree. The light reached a grateful Edward, who sat back in his rickety chair with a satisfied sigh.\n\n"You act like an old man, Eddie," his sister Connie commented. She sat on the floor, a yo-yo in her hand. "Didn't Ma tell you not to sit there?" Edward retorted, a grin creeping up his face. He eyed his mother, who sat next to him with a disapproving look. "Yeah, I did. Girl, that floor is dirty, I haven't cleaned this porch in a decade. You're gonna mess up your dress."\n\nHis sister took the hint, stood and ran down the creaking steps of the porch and into the dusty street. Edward watched her run, and once again sat back in his chair. He couldn't follow her. The Army had advised him to "stay put." For security, apparently.\n\nMa put her hand on his. It was thin and calloused, but with a delicate touch. "The money you've been sending helped pay for electricity yesterday," she said, "Thank you."\n\nHe had never been much for fanfare, but Edward was overjoyed. He showed it with the most genuine smile he could put up. "It's no problem, Ma. I'm gonna keep sending more."\n\nThe door opened suddenly, and out came his other sister. "Where are you going?" Edward lifted his head. "Out," Anais said. She didn't turn to look at him. She was carrying a sign with a slogan about voting rights. Edward stood up, "What'd you mean? We've barely spent time together. I only have some time on leave." Anais snapped her head at him. "You're not the only one trying to help the family, you know?" He wanted to follow after her, badly. But he wondered what kind of trouble he would get if the Army found out.\n\nMa extended her hand at him, and he sat back down."

Edward had been planning to take another long nap as the tracked vehicle drove back to Camp Century, but today the ride was a bit chattier than usual.\n\n"Yeah, that's what I heard," the soldier next to him whispered, "Some kind of bunker in case the nukes go flying. It's for the President, I figure." Sneers and whispers were heard all over the bus.\n\n"But why does the President need so many tunnels, huh?" A soldier near the front retorted, "I think they're trying to colonize the Arctic. We're building a test colony," one in the back blurted out his thoughts. Soon the hushed conversation devolved into a shouting match, as all passengers shot their theories and suspicions in the air.\n\nTheories about Camp Century. A part of Edward wanted to sleep, but he couldn't lie and say that he wasn't at least a little curious too. Everyone was, apparently. Even if their guesses weren't particularly sound, "Look, I bet we're making some kind of space thingie. Think about it, we're up north, that's closer to the stars."\n\n"What do you think, Ed?" The soldier next to him tapped his shoulder, bringing Edward out of his head. All eyes were suddenly on him. Gulping, he realized that while he was curious, he'd never really developed a detailed scenario. He took a moment to compose an answer. "I don't know what we're doing," he said, and turned to see the sun again, "But it's big. And, uh, we won't know how big it is any time soon.""

 antarctica_aao_greenland.100.desc:0 "It was early in the morning when they got called out to the tunnel. The sky was a dull, deep blue, set against a dark landscape. Edward and other drowsy workers shuffled across the snow and into a dark tunnel. Something felt odd today. There were more soldiers than normal, they glared from under the shadow of their helmets. The cold wasn't the only reason it was hard to breathe. Tension was in the air.\n\nA tunnel down south had collapsed. Another to the west was apparently "off limits" now. That's what the rumors said. Now they were marching into another. If he wasn't so tired and sleepy, Edward might have complained about that. Instead he focused on trying to keep his eyes open.\n\nShouting about an emergency woke him up. Emergency repairs. Lights inside the tunnel flickered dimly as they marched deeper and deeper. The walls were narrower. A paled worker ran up to them, pointing deeper inside, where more men surrounded a tilted support beam. It was going to fall soon.\n\nThey struggled for God knows how long. Edward didn't think. If he thought, he would get overwhelmed. All the men did was follow orders, carefully replacing the beam with a new one. Nobody spoke after the initial frantic shouts and prayers. There was a silent relief when the work was done. All was well.\n\nFor a moment, at least. Until the silence was broken by the bitter sound of cracks spreading across the tunnel ceiling. Again nobody made a sound as small bits of ice fell around them. Short, chaotic ideas jumped around Edward's head. The instinct to run was overbearing. Then the lights died out, and every man around him stampeded, trampling and running over each other, all headed the same direction. Out.\n\nBut the falling ice was faster."

 antarctica_aao_greenland.110.desc:0 "Pain. That's the first thing he felt when he woke up. Pain in his legs, and in his arms. Into his chest and up to the head. Everything was caught in a slow, numbing pain. He tried to open his eyes a couple times, but the blinding light overhead rejected every attempt.\n\nWhy was he here? What day was it? The questions got answers as Edward's memory slowly climbed back. The tunnel had collapsed. He and who knows how many others had been buried under snow and ice. He remembered finding himself in an air pocket. That's how he was alive.\n\n"Can you hear me?" A quiet voice called for him. He focused his eyes to the side of his bed, where a foggy figure sat watching him. Colonel Bennett L. Lewis. Edward nodded. "Good," Lewis said. "Private Edward Freeman, I came to give you my most sincere gratitude. You are a hero."\n\nHe didn't feel like a hero, but Edward didn't say anything. "You pulled another man into the air pocket you survived in, Edward. That precious air was limited, but you were willing to share it with another life," What he said, Lewis said with seriousness, "And when we found you, you were still holding him. He was alive. Thanks to you," Lewis motioned to his side, and Edward saw another man on a bed beside him. Ghostly, pale, and frail. But alive. Edward wasn't sure what to say. He didn't know if he had the strength to talk, "I will make sure you receive the Commendation Medal."\n\nThere was silence for a moment, "Of course it's in, erm, your best interest," Lewis added, "Not to talk much about how you received that reward once you get home." That last word caught Edward's attention. His droopy eyes felt watery, as he got the strength to utter a single thing."

 antarctica_aao_greenland.120.desc:0 "It had been a long day for Edward. It started with an emergency call from home, which sent him flying out of his dorm. It was Ma, practically crying to him on the phone. Usually he enjoyed calls from his family.\n\nNow he walked alone, through a tunnel across from the camp's reactor. Well, there used to be a reactor there, anyway. That room and others nearby were buried in snow. The reactor itself was either moved out or buried somewhere in there. Edward hoped it was the former. Since the collapse he'd survived, he was a bit paranoid about walking anywhere underground. Today that was the least of his troubles, though.\n\nMa had called him about his sister, Anais. She'd been in another protest. It got "rough," as his mother put it. And now Anais was in the hospital, unconscious. Edward didn't know how to react when he heard the news. He wanted to say something comforting, to stop Ma from crying. But he was never good with words.\n\nNow he was regretting it. He'd been regretting not being able to say anything, or even just hugging his mother. Or not being able to see his sister. Perhaps that guilt, coupled with the longing for home, drove him to his CO's office to request clearance to leave. Leave this freezing sinkhole now. His CO was skeptical, but interference by Major Lewis did the job. Supposedly a reward for his heroics.\n\nEdward left the tunnel and marched towards the dorms. Packing his things was quick. Fellow roommates said goodbye. If they were lucky, they wouldn't be here for very long either. More tunnels had collapsed. Others were simply being demolished outright, or left to be buried by the elements. Camp Century was being swallowed back into the white sea."

But now, walking through narrow halls full of cold and sterile air, surrounded by the buzz of medical equipment and the dull breathing coming from open rooms, it all crashed onto him like the tunnel of ice. He hated hospitals.\n\nThe room his sister was in was small. His mother looked like she'd aged a couple years since she last saw her, sitting on the only chair in the room, Connie on her lap. Both of them ran up to him when Edward entered, they greeted him with a joy quickly muted as they turned towards Anais.\n\nHer state reminded him of the man he'd saved a couple months prior. Messy unraveled hair surrounded a sickly pair face, wrapped up in an oxygen mask. There was a large bruise on her forehead, growing into her closed eye. Other bruises formed horrible constellations on her arms.\n\nNot showing much emotion was something he was used to, but in that moment he felt everything all at once. Before he knew it his eyes were watery and his face was red with anger. "It was some thugs at the protest, Eddie," his mother said in despair, "Some KKK men."\n\nHearing that made him fume. It was hard to stay still. An urge to scream simmered in his chest. But his fury melted into impotency as he looked at Connie's face, so full of fear and uncertainty. Goddamnit, is this what he came back for?\n\nHe mustered his most stoic face, and hugged Connie close. Ma joined them immediately. And so they stood, as the heart monitor quietly drowned on."

One of those that people give when they're way past the edge, and yet they have to keep going.\n\nEdward sat on the opposite side of the table. They both stayed silent, as the rain continued to pour over the thin roof of their little house, made less of a home by his sister's absence. He looked over the hospital bills again. So many papers, all on his side of the table. He preferred to keep them rather than to let Ma continue to read them and grow more stressed. Her voice nearing a sob every time she spoke.\n\nThousands upon thousands of dollars. All for his sister, who was still unconscious. Her face was on the newspapers. The violent story of a girl attacked by KKK thugs hadn't even caught the headlines. No reporters had knocked on their door, and the police claimed the trail was cold. Edward scoffed bitterly, he knew the Klan had a long reach and many friends. None of his bitterness would help them pay for the hospital stay.\n\n"Maybe I should get an extra job," Ma said, but Edward put his fist down. "No, I'll get a job. Reenlist, maybe," he blurted out. "You don't have to do more. I'll get the money." She already did too much, Edward wasn't prepared to have his mother take on another burden.

A new project, related and set in similar conditions to the ones you experienced in that facility is now being set in motion. The best work crews, machinery, engineers, and officers who operated in Greenland are now set to work on this new project. This is the reason for our communication with you, Mr. Freeman. You have been selected to join this new endeavor.\n\nWe are aware, as said before, that your situation at the moment is less than ideal. Although I urge you to take up this offer, since we deeply believe in your possible contribution to this operation, I understand if you are not able to reenlist at the moment.\n\nIf you are willing to take this offer, then do contact me immediately.

He wasn't sure of the name either. Regardless it played as he and dozens of other men marched across the ice, accompanied by snow crawlers. and Edward looked around at his surroundings.\n\nIt was the same desert of ice. The same rolling hills of gray and white. The same bright blue sky centered around the sun's crown of light. Just like Greenland. Except he was in the total opposite part of the world.\n\nAntarctica was somehow even more sterile than Greenland. As they marched out at McMurdo, Edward couldn't shake the feeling that ahead of him was nothing but an infinite and unforgiving land. For hundreds of miles. It was like looking into an abyss.\n\nSo perhaps the song was some sort of distraction, trying to drown out the howling wind. The thoughts of warm afternoons, yellow and orange leaves, shimmering water in summer days, they were all distractions too. Remembering chirping birds, the chatter of the city, and the voices of his family, Edward planted his shovel into Antarctica for the first time. A new project had begun. Whatever it was.\n\nThe day before he left home again, his sister woke up. Her first instinct was to declare she would get better as soon as possible. Edward smiled as he continued his work. His sister was strong. While she stayed strong, he would keep helping them from afar. Even as far as the frozen continent, if necessary."

 antarctica_aao_science.10.desc:0 "The Institute for Polar Studies at Ohio State University was a small organization, having only been founded two years prior, but as Lois Jones, a Chemistry masters pursuing a doctorate in geology, entered the building, she could feel that it buzzed with an uncharacteristically nervous excitement.\n\nThe call of, "Congratulations, Jones!" greeted her as she walked further in, which led the bewildered Lois to start in the direction of the head of the institute. Before she got there, however, Colin Bull pulled her aside and into his office.\n\nBull was a New Zealander who had recently joined the faculty at OSU due to their specialization in Antarctic studies. He was a good man and a worthwhile connection with the land down under - especially given his inroads in his home country. "Jones, I've just gotten a call from Wellington - you're being given the go ahead to study at McMurdo."\n\nLois stared back in shock, her mind racing. Bull had been pushing for the OAA to allow the first female scientist to study on Antarctica since '59, but while he'd managed to sway all the officially relevant parties, the US Navy outright refused to allow her passage south.\n\nThankfully, Bull had met Edmund Hilary a few times before, and their correspondence brought the Kiwi explorer firmly to their side. He had supposedly convinced Admiral Raborn himself to force the issue, and now it seemed the Navy was quietly backing down.\n\n"I didn't think you'd actually do it," Lois replied, a smile flitting her face.\n\n"If you knew Hilary, you would have. Nothing deters that man," Bull said, eyes slightly wistful. He then reached under his desk, pulling out a sheaf of paper, "Here, a list of what you'll need before you leave.""

 antarctica_aao_science.20.desc:0 "The clouds hanging over Antarctica muddled the line between the horizon and the snowy caps of the hills that embraced McMurdo Station, giving Lois an unusual first view of the subject of her studies and casting the landscape in a surreal light.\n\nIt was a place bereft of anything that held the eye, nigh untouched by humans, and blanketed in a serene steadiness, all of which instantly set it apart from anywhere she had been before - to think that she had once seen parts of Ohio as being barren. Meanwhile, the early winter winds sheared her down to muscle and bones, her nerves so numb she could hardly imagine them working properly again. This was a land so unlike any other on Earth.\n\nShe had been standing at the bow since dawn, watching as her final destination drew closer. The ship taking her to McMurdo was equipped to cut through ice - otherwise it would have been impossible to make it to the harbor this late in fall - which meant their approach was accompanied by the cracking of ice.\n\nIt was her only companion until the ship came to a grinding halt and men started running around the deck, preparing a staircase onto the ice pier below and hauling up supplies McMurdo had left there for them. The timing of this trip had been a tight thing, and she knew the captain was eager to be off as soon as they were reprovisioned.\n\nShaking the numbness out of her arms and legs, she set off down the stairs, finding a small greeting party at their base. At their lead as the one reason she the Navy had allowed her to come here at all: Edmund Hillary. The New Zealander shook her hand and introduced his companions - a couple geologists she might collaborate with and lead researcher at the base - before shepherding the group off towards some nearby vehicles."

 antarctica_aao_science.30.desc:0 "It was the wind that first signaled the arrival of winter. It slipped through any protection and whipped at her very bones, leaving a hollow pit where one her body had once resided. Perhaps that was an extreme way to think of it, but she certainly felt that it was true.\n\nThe following weeks saw McMurdo completely change. The daily routine of most personnel shifted as the days grew shorter and shorter, while special systems were installed to help navigate the snow-strewn and ice-laden roads. A few innovative groups had even started pulling straws to decide who had to brave the storm outside and who got to reside in relative comfort.\n\nLois was conspicuously left out of these cliques. In fact, she was left out of most things. The men around base didn't have much interest in including the 'stocky' and 'unwomanly' scientist in their arrangements, and those who did usually had... ulterior motives. She was quick to shut down any conversations that went in that direction.\n\nSo, isolated and stuck indoors at the onset of a winter she could never have dreamed up, Lois buried herself in her research. One thing she couldn't fault the continent for was a lack of specimens to examine. Rocks abounded in less snowy months, and she had collected enough samples to last her till Christmas. One set of nearby valleys, the aptly named McMurdo Dry Valleys, had piqued her interest, and she found herself presently surrounded by neatly sorted stones with mysteries just waiting to be unraveled.\n\nA rap at the door interrupted her thoughts, and in came her assistant, Mark Nelson. He was one of the few people she felt truly comfortable around, along with Hillary and some other scientists, and though he was too dry and career-driven to cultivate a real friendship with, she welcomed his heavy clomping boots and fresh reams of paper."

However, as the light filled more and more windows and the shadows were short enough to leave patches of melting snow on clear days, it became undeniable that the days were growing longer.\n\nIt was in these improving conditions that Lois Jones found herself at the top of a hill overlooking McMurdo at dusk, surrounded by a ramshackle collection of scientists, engineers, and particularly curious soldiers. They were in the process of setting up a stargazing night, something one of the more sociable researchers - unsurprisingly a visiting astronomer - had proposed they arrange before the night itself left them in favor of the never ending daylight of Antarctic summers.\n\nLois, being one of the few scientists to have worked in an observatory (briefly, while still an undergrad at OSU) was put in charge of one of the telescopes. She had to go through quite the ordeal just getting it to stand on the uneven hill, but to her surprise, a couple of the soldiers came over to clear the ground of rocks and place some bags under the telescope's feet.\n\nIt was interactions like these that gave her hope she might still find a position in the odd, insular community McMurdo bred. These sorts of things had been happening more frequently recently, and she recognized one of the soldiers as someone to help her before.\n\n"Charles, I didn't expect you were the sort to like stargazing."\n\n"Call it an oddity for me, ma'am. Well then," he said, looking upwards, "it seems like the first stars are peeking through. I'm guessing now's the time to do that 'gazing'. Ladies first." He finished with a cheeky, affable smirk."

This was an aberrant land, one that seduced only the most daring with its frigid splendor. She was one of those lucky - or perhaps unlucky - enough to be drawn to the cold plain, intent on puncturing its heretofore staunch fortress against human incursion.\n\nAnd so, the pilot descended towards the McMurdo Dry Valleys, the focus of Lois' research. They were a vexing anomaly on the continent: snow and ice-free and completely devoid of any detected life. The former allowed unparalleled access to the towering granite peaks while the latter made for a haunting work environment. Nevertheless, she was looking forward to settling into the valleys, as her brief time with them last fall had captured her imagination. They were prime grounds for important discoveries to be made: a patch of frozen, uncovered earth ripe for careful research.\n\nFurther north, snow-draped cliffs and spires seemingly spun from glass concealed the vast whiteness that led all the way to the South Pole. Those vistas were obscured and, eventually, disappeared as the helicopter landed, kicking up the ashy gray dust of one of the most extreme deserts on Earth in the process.\n\nStepping out onto the stark landscape, Lois breathed in a crisp breath of air. Last she was here, she had been ignorant to scientific procedure in the southern wastes and ill-integrated into life at McMurdo. Now, she was fully prepared to tackle the mysteries of Antarctic geology, backed by a handful of competent assistants and aides who she would cycle through over the course of the summer."

Among the busy end-of-day merriment, Lois joined a temporarily expanded corps of scientists.\n\nMathew was already rambling about the intricacies of practicing chemistry in subzero temperatures to some paleontologists from Canada, Thomas had rallied a small group of assistants and was hosting an impromptu quiz, and though Wahlman was off in Tasmania, his passion lived on in the form of a student who had coopted Lois' dinner to regale her with the peculiarities of nuclear power. She was starting to see why Wahlman was so solemn in his duty.\n\nLooking around the hazy room, Lois found herself more settled than she had been just last week. The past months had seen her fitting into the local community more and more - even as she remained excluded by some on the basis of her gender. Along with her increased correspondence with her peers back in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, Lois was starting to feel content with her present position in life.\n\nRelatedly, she had some letters to write.\n\nRaising her beer in a final salute to her companions in exile, she bundled up and psyched herself up to brave the biting cold."

What sort of mission are you seeking, and why?"\n\n"Well, I've been in contact with some colleagues throughout the OFN," she began her prepared speech, "There are plenty of scientists interested in doing work down here, and many are even specializing in Antarctic research. It seems only natural that we give them an opportunity to study onsite."\n\n"You make good points. I've told Raborn the same when inviting those I've advocated for," Hillary stopped, his forehead creaked in thought, "I'll bring this to him myself. I will need names though. Do you have a shortlist?"\n\nLois took a deep breath. This was the make-or-break moment of this conversation, "I do have a few. How do Sienna Price, Alexandra Scott, and Bonnie Porter sound?" She quieted as she recounted the names, clearly apprehensive about Hillary's response.\n\nHe gave her a slight conspiratorial smile before responding, "Yes, they work perfectly. I'll talk with the Vice Admiral tomorrow about your plans. He won't like it, but I think your outstanding performance thus far should assuage the US Navy enough that he backs down - and if not, there are ways of forcing his hand. Either way, I look forward to seeing his face when he hears these names." He let out a short laugh, lent back, and offered Lois some Bourbon."

Preparing to lead a research team, coordinating with her doctoral advisor back in Columbus, and securing grant money had created the most hectic months of her life, all while she continued to collect samples and instrument readings from the dry valleys periodically.\n\nWinter's onset had signaled the end of constant planning. Instead, Lois was hunkering down to tackle the mounds of stones and minerals that had accumulated in her laboratory. She had even started writing her dissertation, though progress on it would be minimal until she finished examining this year's haul from the valleys.\n\nSighing, she stood and stretched her back out, certain that looking into a microscope was made to give researchers spinal pain. Picking up the coffee Mark had brought just moments ago, she realized that it had lost its steam, and sipping it clarified that moments were more likely hours. Either way, coffee was coffee, so staring out a window into the incessant snowfall, Lois contemplated the future.\n\nFor now she was biding her time, waiting for September and the fateful arrival that would heap a new set of responsibilities and concerns onto her shoulders. Thinking about where her life might go next, she couldn't help but smirk. Despite what some said, she hadn't gotten into academia for a boring existence..."

 antarctica_aao_science.90.desc:0 "The thunder of two heaving engines struggling against the frosty cold boomed in Lois' ears as the plane came to a stop, rumbling its dissatisfaction with its present environs. She couldn't blame it. Having begun its journey in Toronto and making pit stops all along the way to McMurdo, it was only due to well wrought steel that it arrived in one piece - likely midwestern steel, the Ohioan in Lois quietly pointed out.\n\nIts cargo was from far beyond the bounds of the Great Lakes region, even North America. As they descended the backramp, the geologist was greeted by a slew of fresh figures.\n\nGoing through introductions, she put faces to previously known names. Sienna was a quiet physicist from New Jersey, Alexandra came from Melbourne and was looking to make an explosive start to her meteorology career, and Bonnie was a New Zealander intent on finding evidence to back her anthropology theories.\n\nAll-in-all there were six new researchers in Lois' team, each concentrating on a different topic that would be impossible to study elsewhere. Listening to their excited comments as they walked the runway and marveled at the landscape - something that still left Lois awestruck from time to time - her mind wandered to the precarious location in which they found themselves.\n\nThe shadowy military projects that stormed through McMurdo were a constant reminder that tensions with Germany and Japan remained high, and for all that Hillary tried to assure the civilian scientists of the lack of threat the OAA faced, there was always a bit of concern and helplessness worrying at the back of her mind.\n\nThat was part of why she had commissioned this team. She was taking some control back from the chaotic void of global politics, a void into which Antarctica was swirling."

 antarctica_aao_science.100.desc:0 "The clink of ice and glasses chilled in the open Antarctic air resounded through the small lab, chairs pulled together in a makeshift circle. Lois' team sported red noses and rosy cheeks, and not just from the alcohol.\n\nThey had spent most of the day climbing to a local viewpoint. It was a breathtaking sight, especially with the eternal sunshine of summer painting the ground in blinding white lacquer. Such a view never got old, and Lois found that it put life into perspective a bit. Here stands a continent, the ancient, untouched landscape seemed to declare, immutable to the ravages of human folly.\n\nUnfortunately, the scientists' world possessed no such remit. Power struggles in Germany, a financial crisis in Japan, and now South Africa was going to hell with the United States leading the charge. At least there was a cause worth championing in the latter. The news that filtered through the station from the military presence only spoke of even more chaos expected to emerge in the coming months.\n\nAnd yet, looking around at her tightly-bundled team, global news and growing concerns felt an ocean away, though New Swabia's recent plight proved otherwise. They had just about finished settling into their research labs, though there were high hopes that they'd soon be greenlit to venture inland and potentially even establish a new outpost.\n\n"I'd like to make a toast," she blurted quietly, interrupting the small talk of the circle. "To our future adventures pushing at the bounds of the world."\n\nThere was a moment of silence, the other womens' faces all lost in thought, no doubt thinking about their own plans. Then, they cried out. "To the future!""

A cup of coffee sat untouched on his desk, the steam wafting up and curling around the back of his hand.\n\nLicking his dry lips, Raborn calmly set the handset back on its cradle, picked it up again, and dialed Rear Admiral Reedy's internal office number. "James," he said, "could you come to my office?" He hung up again. Then, finally, he took a sip of heavenly coffee.\n\nThe minutes ticked by. Ideas flitted through Raborn's mind. Suddenly there came a knock at the door, and Raborn's right hand entered the room. Before Reedy could even open his mouth, Raborn said, "The Joint Chiefs have authorized an action against New Swabia at my discretion."\n\nReedy shut the door as his jaw fell open, "Oh. Well... now's as good a time as any, I suppose. Our men on the border report that the Krauts are pulling back a good number of their garrisoned forces. The border's becoming more porous by the day. MACA-SOG's reports of supply issues seem to have some truth to them."\n\n"The Joint Chiefs informed me this operation will have to be conducted with limited resources. The war in Africa is consuming most of the OFN's logistical and military capacity, and as you know, our rapid reaction force is currently engaged in South Africa. We will have to make meticulous preparations, this continent does not treat the unprepared well."\n\n"So we'll have to get creative with our manpower sources?""

Many of the maps were also adorned with climatological reports, painting a grim picture of the weather.\n\nRaborn, Reedy, and a dozen other officers had spent many sleepless nights carefully planning the invasion of New Swabia. Hopefully nothing would be left to chance. While they were in discussion over the table, the phone rang, and Raborn answered. "Hello? Hermann?" The room fell silent. All eyes turned to the Vice Admiral.\n\n"William," said Hermann Phleger, "since the Brazilians are already co-belligerents in South Africa, we've approached them about the operation in Antarctica. They're enthusiastic about joining us, to say the least."\n\n"Well, they've been hungry for a slice of Antarctica for years. It's good to know we'll have the Brazilians' support." All around Raborn, men exchanged nods of approval and even the odd smile.\n\n"You can expect a flotilla carrying several companies to land in the west of the German claim. I'll have the name of your opposite number among the Brazilians in a few hours."\n\n"Excellent, Hermann, thank you. What about the other opportunity we spoke about? The Uruguayans."\n\nA brief pause. "Too soon to say. They want their piece of the continent, the claim they made in 1954 before the Nazis rolled through and seized it, but the Herrerists vehemently oppose involvement in foreign wars so we will have to work around them." Following a few short notes, Raborn wrapped up the call and hung up. The mood in the room was significantly elevated."

He sighed and went back to his desk, taking a sip of coffee before deciding to get back to work.\n\nThe truth was, the Brazilians would be even easier to convince than the Uruguayans. They had wanted a piece of Antarctica for some time, "They clearly haven't spent much time there," he said to himself with a chuckle. But Phleger guessed that they wanted to compete with the Argentineans.\n\nBrazil had also recently had trouble with the Nazis overfishing in their waters. Heck, they were also getting involved in the South African War. And what was Operation Southern Cross but an extension of the great battle against Nazism."

 antarctica_aao_invasion.40.t:0 "A Plea to Uruguay"
 antarctica_aao_invasion.40.desc:0 "Phleger sat down with a typewriter and, after thinking a moment of how to word this, he started with the following:\n\n“Wise Ambassador,\n\nThe OFN Antarctic Administration has found itself an opportune moment to strike at the barbaric Nazi regime's operations on the southernmost continent. Given your nation's history with Germany, we believe that you might be interested in assisting us in this noble endeavor.”\n\nGetting the help of the Uruguayans would be a major boon. It shouldn't be too difficult. The Nazis had been meddling in Uruguayan politics, having recently supported a coup against their government. They were currently sitting on Uruguay's Antarctic claim which they occupied following a short-lived exploratory mission to the region conducted by Uruguay in 1954. Indeed, the Nazis had done most of his work for him, he figured.\n\nOf course, they needed to sweeten the deal for the Uruguayans. He pointed out in his letter that this would strengthen their relationship with the OFN, but of course, they'd need more than that. So he made some more offers. A research cooperative with the OFN and sovereign control over their own claim in the west of what was now New Swabia.\n\nPhleger felt confident. This was offering quite a bit, and the Uruguayans would be foolish to turn this offer down. In truth, it was a win-win scenario. In addition to the military assistance, having nations outside of the OFN actively working with the OAA would help increase its international legitimacy."

The preparations were made as best they could be, supplies and munitions had been stockpiled at outposts along the border; these would be used as jumping off points for the operation. The weather was grim, but they had to push forward anyway. There may not be another chance to take advantage of Germany's weakness and liberate territory from their clutches.\n\nWarfare in Antarctica was very ad hoc. Most military equipment was never designed to function on this unforgiving continent. Much of what their units marched with was modified by McMurdo. Snow crawlers were given more armour to withstand small arms and the limited anti-tank weapons fielded in Antarctica. That was the hope, anyway. For the most part, the invasion would be spearheaded by light infantry clad in their warmest parkas.\n\n"Forward reconnaissance," said Reedy, "reports that the Germans have pulled back from most of their positions along the border. We might be marching in unopposed."\n\n"What about our allies?" Raborn asked.\n\n"The Brazilian flotilla is en route to the west of New Swabia. They should be landing in the next few hours, and contingents of Uruguayans have made landfall to the east of them."\n\n"So this is it, then. Our first war in Antarctica."\n\n"A damned shame it's come to this," said Hillary. "This place could be so much more than just another graveyard."\n\n"It's not going to bury us," Raborn affirmed.

The invasion of New Swabia had begun.\n\nThe OAA soldiers began to climb out of their outposts, frozen fox holes, their pykrete fortifications, their... ice castles. They moved in silence as many climbed into armored snow crawlers.\n\nLush and Sergeant Bird continued marching along with the rest of the army, snow crawlers leading the way. They knew at any moment, the Germans might attack. Their heads were on a swivel, constantly looking over any hill, or the horizon when there weren't any hills, for any trouble.\n\nBut they continued to march, wordlessly, towards New Swabia. There was seemingly no response at all from the Germans. Lush kept looking about, trying to figure out what was going on. Surely, they didn't just abandon the line completely.\n\nThe only explanation that occurred to Lush was that... the Germans wanted them to attack like this. But if this was a trap, where was it? Why haven't they sprung it yet? He continued moving, visualizing traps and ambushes they'd set off with every step. Every time he took a step and a mine did not go off, or an ambush failed to happen, he could only reason it was a lure for something even worse just one more step ahead."

But as long as he couldn't see them, they were a nebulous threat, something he couldn't just shoot.\n\nThat's when he heard the click. A loud bang erupted in the trenches. A geyser of fire and ice shot up in the air. His second in command, Bird, was knocked to the ground by the ice. Lush shouted, "Bird, Bird, are you ok?" He could only barely make out the sound of his own voice over his ears ringing, as he leaned over to check on his friend.\n\nBird was missing half his face. His remaining eye looked at Lush briefly, then Bird stopped moving altogether. Lush froze a moment, his desire to vomit only suppressed by an instinct to react. In his remaining, good ear, he heard radio chatter, people screaming about ambushes.\n\nLush felt an ungodly anger within him. He gave one order:"

"Basically," Reedy said, his face ashen, "the Nazis are making sure we pay dearly for every inch of ground we take. The reports of them falling back seem part of a ruse as much as an act of desperation. Many of the outposts and forward fortifications encountered by our troops were booby trapped and mined. This has taken a severe toll on our vanguard. Once our men cleared the first belt of fortifications, they encountered killzones covered by isolated units of German snipers and anti-tank rocketeers, the latter of which have decimated our fleet of snow crawlers. The weather is preventing any form of air support, meaning our units are having to meet the enemies head-on, on their terms."\n\n"But," Raborn said, feeling like a battered prize fighter, "are we gaining ground?"\n\n"That's the good news," said Reedy. "The Nazis plan was to slow us down, not stop us completely. We're still on track to break through further into New Swabia, but without heavier support, we're unlikely to reach Schirmacher itself. The Brazilians have successfully landed in the west, and based on initial reports, faced little resistance. New Swabia seems not to have reinforced that section of their claim. The Uruguayans have also moved rapidly, occupying several abandoned bases."\n\nAfter a sobering silence, Raborn asked, "Has there been any indication of the Germans moving heavy equipment to counter us? Any sign of tactical nuclear weapons?"\n\n"Not for the moment, but if the Germans get desperate enough…""
