MCW_Odilo_Globocnik: "Odilo Globocnik"
POLITICS_MCW_ODILO_GLOBOCNIK_DESC: "Just what use has having the "right men" in the "right place" at the "right time" been for the German project in Eastern Europe thus far? If there is one man that can testify to the futility of such personnel decisions, it is Reichskommissar Odilo Lothar Ludwig Globocnik of Moskowien.\n\n"Globus" was deployed to the colony of Muscovy by Heinrich Himmler to hold the top positions in all sectors of the territory: SS, police, NSDAP, and all offices pertaining to the racial hierarchy and German settlement. In that role Globocnik continued the policy of a National Socialist hardliner with a somewhat pragmatic streak in dealings with collaborators, just like his predecessor Kasche.\n\nGlobocnik's rule in Moskowien, though brutal, is slowly failing. This is not incompetence. No, it is rather that the political landscape of the Reichskommissariat Moskowien requires far more than a man of Globocnik's limited caliber could provide. He knows this, and the dread of the place devours him day in and day out. For years now, Globocnik has constantly felt torn apart by the constant numbing monotony to which he is subject.\n\nOdilo Globocnik's life feels like purgatory—or perhaps hell—for all the opportunities he has left behind. Like Sisyphus, Globocnik is forced to repeat the same motions every day. But he cannot ever imagine happiness except in the past conditional tense. When that reality is combined with Globocnik's tendency since his time in Lublin to resort to pills and alcohol as a coping mechanism, the result is a slow lurch towards madness and a constant obsession over how things might have been."
MCW_Wolf_Heinrich_Graf_von_Helldorff: "Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf"
POLITICS_MCW_WOLF_HEINRICH_GRAF_VON_HELLDORFF_DESC: "In the Führer—not whatever knockoff has taken over, the real one—Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf used to see a man who embodied every hope and desire Helldorf had for the Volk and the Fatherland. Helldorf is devoted to National Socialism as taught in the Years of Struggle; what presents itself today, as such, no longer meets with his total approval. Thus Helldorf simultaneously epitomizes and is anathema to the earliest strain of National Socialism.\n\nHelldorf was a young, fit man not even 20 years old sent into the meat grinder of the Great War and returning broken and hungry for vengeance. He joined the NSDAP to guarantee the German people freedom from spiritual and material slavery. But the first cracks in this identity appear as soon as you look at this so-called party comrade's name: Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf.\n\nHelldorf joined a revolutionary movement to establish a new order, but is happiest if people call him by his full aristocratic name. He believes in Revolutionary Nazism, but uses any position he gets for self-enrichment. The man is intelligent but selfish, charming but sleazy, avaricious but fiscally imbecilic. He drinks often, but is not a drunk; amidst all this he somehow maintains a link to the Christianity of his youth. Years have passed thus—spent in an iron hell of debauchery and bitter eyes cast upon Germania.\n\nBut with the Disruption, the old man rallied other geriatric Alte Kämpfer around him and deposed Globocnik; he now holds the keys to the colony. Being a man with no future, only the here and now, Helldorf will use his power to build a monument. Not just to himself, but the ideals long lost to Nazism—and perhaps also to Ernst Röhm and Joseph Goebbels, those friends Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf abandoned and lost so long ago."
MCW_Claus_Von_Stauffenberg: "Claus von Stauffenberg"
POLITICS_MCW_CLAUS_VON_STAUFFENBERG_DESC: "For Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, a German noble who has never joined the NSDAP, this is a dream come true. After decades, the last guard of old Prussia has managed to meaningfully weaken the Nazi apparatus that holds it in thrall.\n\nYet the day is not completely won: the Stauffenberg administration is beset by problems. The coalition is unstable. Von Stauffenburg's brand of 'aristocratic' militarism, envisioning an idealized version of medieval Germany leading Europe to a new level of culture and civilization, is contentious and frequently rubbished by his brother officers.\n\nIt took the retired general Dietrich von Saucken to weave the big tent of resistance together. In his absence, the plan was certain to have failed; thanks to him, however, the matter succeeded. Yet though Globocnik and von Helldorf are gone the problems they created remain troublesome, and the region of Muscovy cannot be called anything resembling "stable".\n\nWith the colony reeling under the pressure of Ivan Vorobyov's partisan offensive, it falls to von Stauffenberg to quickly stabilize the situation before things get out of hand or rival factions take control. Then, he must hand power over to someone with a clean reputation in Germania to entrench the administration and ensure that this small victory can be built upon."
MCW_Fritz_Dietlof_Von_Der_Schulenburg: "Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg"
POLITICS_MCW_FRITZ_DIETLOF_VON_DER_SCHULENBURG_DESC: "Fritz-Dietlof Graf von der Schulenburg was never a man seeking a public career. He did not lust after a position, and that is why he was given a position. Those that selected him could not but admire his past service. A steadfast civil servant his entire life and a military officer in the reserve, he remained undefiled by corruption and the petty squabbles of Nazi intrigue.\n\nBut under the surface something else rears its head. Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg can rightly be termed a walking contradiction; a Nazi might accuse him of crypto-socialism. A friend of SPD newspaper editors in his youth, he sympathized enough with the workers to join Leninist circles at night.\n\nWith a reading list like that, one might have expected von der Schulenburg to hate the monarchy. What is surprising is that he hated the Weimar republic also. The man dreamed of a "Germano-Slavic" destiny whereby Germany carved an empire out of Eastern Europe while somehow also living harmoniously with the native peoples. More dangerous for von der Schulenburg's position, however, is that he envisions the organization of a post-Nazi Germany and a Moskowien made free from the yoke of Nazism.\n\nWith such sentiments von der Schulenburg has achieved the dubious accomplishment of being more controversial than von Stauffenberg, and being even more reliant on the geriatric General Dietrich von Saucken to hold the aged circle together. Whether such a vision can be executed to any extent upon a carcass like Moskowien is yet to be seen."
MCW_Mikhail_Oktan: "Mikhail Oktan"
POLITICS_MCW_MIKHAIL_OKTAN_DESC: "Few collaborators are as total a butt of mockery as Mikhail Oktan is. "Talented scoundrel and adventurer", "utter rascal", "servile, clever fanatic": these are all things that men who knew him have called him. One former associate described him as consciously imitating the appearance and gestures of Adolf Hitler.\n\nAnd why should they not call him such things? More than virtually any other leading collaborationist, Oktan trips over his own feet to toe the Nazi line on the "Jewish question". He waxes poetic about fighting the "Jewish microbe" with the same devotion as any petty Party prefect.\n\nOktan almost exactly matches the NSDAP line on Bolshevism—that is, that it is a tool in the service of the Jews, striving for world rule. Having failed in Russia, he affirms, they then tried to spread communism to the West until German arms put an end to it. No collaborationist identifies more totally with National Socialism than Mikhail Oktan.\n\nOktan insists that Germany, unlike Moscow, was not forcing its system on Russia; it permits the restoration of land, customs, and religion. Regardless of the reality on the ground, he "skillfully combines the qualities of a German officer, an Odessan tradesman, and a clever lickspittle." When these qualities are combined with Oktan's deliberate imitation of Hitler's appearance, it is obvious that this man envisions himself a Führer over the Russian people."

MCW_An_Empty_Throne: "An Empty Throne"
MCW_An_Empty_Throne_desc: "The emptiness and torment of the post of Reichskommissar of Moskowien is partly, but not entirely, a disaster of Odilo Globocnik's own making. His personality and intellect, though by no means that of an incompetent or traitor, are simply insufficient to meet the demands of the office—the bleak political landscape of the Reichskommissariat simply requires far, far more.\n\nThat alone would be enough of a problem to slowly break anyone's mind. But the bleak political landscape also contains hostile actors that constantly work against the Reichskommissar's will. Internal rivals such as Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorf and outside hostiles such as the Wehrmacht in Moskowien question and sabotage the Globocnik administration at every turn, making the already onerous task of governing even more difficult."
MCW_Puppet_Kings_Court: "Puppet King's Court"
MCW_Puppet_Kings_Court_desc: "As the Romans used to have puppet kings and queens, the Reichskommissar of Moskowien has the All-Muscovite Congress. Formed near the end of the Second World War to consolidate the remaining Muscovite collaborators into a single structure, it is controlled by Mikhail Oktan and Bronislav Kaminski.\n\nIn the aftermath of the defections or desertions of more prominent collaborationist organizations such as the ROA and ROVS, the remaining relevant collaborators are all loyal sycophants of the NSDAP in Moskowien. These "puppet kings", modern day clones of Herod the Great, eagerly continue their collaboration as they have for two decades now."
MCW_The_Wasteland: "The Wasteland"
MCW_The_Wasteland_desc: "Moskowien is a hell on earth for everyone living there. There is no concept of peace; internal commotion, if not outright warfare, is a constant. There is no notion of prosperity; wealth is unheard of for more than ninety-nine out of every hundred residents. The region is a wasteland—and that is just how the National Socialist German Workers' Party that has colonized it wanted to be.\n\nThose that wait for relief to come by way of partisan activity hold on to a vain hope. After twenty years of occupation, resistance has long been stymied. Those troops that could flee into the western regions of the Russian Anarchy have done so; the remainder have just come to terms with German rule."

MCW_Crown_Of_The_Old_Fighter_desc: "The Muscovite sector of the National Socialist German Workers' Party has managed, somehow, someway, to survive the Second Kampfzeit without blemishes. A new Führer's presence, however, does not mean that it can relax or rest on its laurels. How could it ever do so, in the wasteland that it has created out of the Reichskommissariat Moskowien?\n\nBehind closed doors, the knives are drawn. Reichskommissar Odilo Globocnik and his ancient political rival, Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, fight for total control over Moskowien. These aging men, left-behind figures of the early "glory days" of National Socialism, are now left squabbling over scraps of the periphery of Hitler's empire. "
MCW_Purgatory: "Purgatory"
MCW_Purgatory_desc: "Globocnik and Helldorf are left-behind figures of the early "glory days" of National Socialism. Their patrons and allies are long gone for one reason or another, their influence in the homeland from which they came equally nonexistent. As a result, these two men are trapped in the Reichskommissariat and have no hope whatsoever of ever attaining a higher office back in Germany.\n\nHaving long since resigned themselves to this fate, however, the two powerbrokers at the top of the Moskowien NSDAP have countless ambitions and grand designs that—they believe—will make it more tolerable. If this castle is to be my own, they think, let me at least brighten it up. But only Heaven knows just how much brighter the castle will be after they have left it."

MCW_Vassals_At_Most_desc: "As the Romans used to have puppet kings and queens, the Reichskommissar of Moskowien has the All-Muscovite Congress—but does he want to anymore, these days? The Romans, after all, did away with their puppet kingdoms one by one as Latin or Hellenistic bureaucrats and colonists put down roots in those lands.\n\nThe new government of the Reichskommissariat of Moskowien has, in general, striven to undermine the All-Muscovite Congress and its leadership. Moskowien's aim is clear: if the Reichskommissar has his way, the final form of the Congress will be a neutralized body without even the current (harshly limited) influence it currently wields."

MCW_Crown_Of_The_Perfumed_Rioter_desc: "By a mixture of personal appeals, bribery, and simple coercion, the Reichskommissariat Moskowien is now under the control of Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, who has successfully subverted his old superior's control over the colony. An old guard of the NSDAP, an ex-member of the Sturmabteilung, and an adherent to Social Revolutionary thought, Helldorf's regime will usher in a different structure of governance in Muscovy.\n\nThanks to Helldorf's assertion of control, the AOdNSDAP in Moskowien now stands united at long last, after the doldrums of the 1950s. It marches in firm lockstep, just like the Sturmabteilung of old once did."
MCW_Marching_On_Heaven: "Marching on Heaven"
MCW_Marching_On_Heaven_desc: "The Reichskommissariat Moskowien as ruled by Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorf predicates itself upon an older form of National Socialism—one dating back to the era of the first Kampfzeit. In those days, Helldorf and his other aged compatriots insist, the values of National Socialism were as yet untarnished.\n\nThough the rest of Germany is now lost to other forms of Nazism less pure than what Helldorf holds on to, at last he and his party comrades have a place to test their ideas. Today the Sturmabteilung marches once more in the Reichskommissariat Moskowien. It is the Reichskommissar, Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, who will lead them to heaven by the path that Adolf Hitler first trod."
MCW_Levies_At_Most: "Levies at Most"
MCW_Levies_At_Most_desc: "The Reichskommissariat Moskowien as envisioned by Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorf is a much more hardline one with respect to collaborators than its predecessors. Such a paradigm shift was made clear by the trial and execution of Bronislav Kaminski within weeks of Helldorf's assuming power, along with the ensuing total liquidation of the Tver Autonomy.\n\nIn the directives of the new Reichskommissar, the duties of policing and defending the eastern frontier of the Reich will now lie in the hands of the Muscovite Wehrmacht and German settlers themselves. Collaborators, on the other hand, will have their role massively reduced, and play no greater role than that of a levy raised or stood down at will by the Reichskommissar."

He is ready to execute his will upon the colony; he is the ailing laughingstock of the Schutzstaffel no more. No longer is he a pathetic man ridden down by illness and cheated out of a relationship by a diktat handed down by his own mother. He is the Reichskommissar of Moskowien, Goddamn it!\n\nOdilo Globocnik is cowed no more. He is a man in control, and he will prove it. Germania will know, once and for all, that they made the right decision. There is no man more fit to rule the Eastern border of the Reich in its name than him."

MCW_Marching_On_The_Earthly_Realm_desc: "Odilo Globocnik is at long last in total control of the Reich's eastern frontier and sits unquestioned as Reichskommissar of Moskowien. He is, therefore, free to act as he wishes—an opportunity he will take with both hands. To that end, Globocnik has decreed the unadulterated implementation of the National Socialist project in the east.\n\nThere is to be nothing less than the full implementation of Generalplan Ost as it was originally envisioned. Obstacles and challenges are of no import and will be shoved past. It has been thus once already, and will continue to be so. Globocnik triumphed once over unimaginable odds, and his will shall triumph over reality itself."

MCW_Knighthood_For_The_Loyal_desc: "Odilo Globocnik desires no return to the status quo ante bellum in respect to collaborator autonomy. However, unlike his more ... devout contemporaries in the AOdNSDAP, he sees the value of promoting those with unceasing loyalty to the Nazi project into leading positions as and when appropriate. In this respect, the Reichskommissar has not changed.\n\nAbominations such as the Tver Autonomy are to be things of the past, of course. But the good and loyal Russians of Moskowien, those who understand their duty and accept their submission to the Reichskommissar and the Germanic Reich, will have ample autonomy to climb up the rungs of power if they put down bandits and traitors with sufficient alacrity."

MCW_The_Brass_Throne_desc: "No more will witless hedonists and assorted bandits claiming to serve the German people be permitted to carry on their misgovernance of the Reichskommissariat Moskowien. The NSDAP offices in Moskowien have been shuttered, and a martial law government has been established by decree of the Wehrmacht.\n\nBut not all is well. The downfall of the Wehrmacht may have been sown by the very act of its assuming power. Sorting out the chaos left behind by the drug-addled traitors Helldorf and Globocnik while at the same time withstanding Vorobyov's partisan offensive has left it reeling. The continuance of Claus von Stauffenberg's government is thus far from certain."

MCW_Ghost_Carnival_desc: "The fact of the collapse of the NSDAP government in Moskowien does not mean that those that have replaced it can in any way rest easily. The downfall of the Wehrmacht may have been sown by the very act of its assuming power, as a partisan front led by Ivan Vorobyov threatens its continued control of the region.\n\nWhile the population centers remain under government control, the partisans have free reign elsewhere. As a result, so long as suitable countermeasures are not taken, the government has lost hold of remote regions of Muscovy."
MCW_Dance_Of_The_Jesters: "Dance of the Jesters"
MCW_Dance_Of_The_Jesters_desc: "When Rome was beleaguered by civil war, its client states would assert themselves, covering over the holes in its defense—or, sometimes, exploiting them for their own benefit. So it is with the Moskowien of today.\n\nDue to the widespread chaos created by the Vorobyov partisan offensive, the Wehrmacht is incapable of pacifying Moskowien on its own. It is forced, therefore, to rely upon the collaborator organizations represented in the All-Muscovite Congress—the Union of Struggle Against Bolshevism and the People's Socialist Party of Russia—to keep order. This, however, also creates an opening for them to expand their own power"

MCW_Crown_Of_The_Red_Count: "Crown of the Red Count"
MCW_Crown_Of_The_Red_Count_desc: "Today, Fritz-Dietlof Graf von der Schulenburg sits as undisputed master of the lands of Moskowien. He has many ambitions, which are often contradictory. The new governor sits torn between several sets of irreconcilable beliefs; for instance, he dreams of a German utopia in Eastern Europe that will also dwell in harmony with the native peoples of the land.\n\nYet behind him sit a coterie of aging old Prussians, generals representing the last gasp of the old Imperial aristocracy that is now a mere memory to the Germany of the Sixties. These men are the font of von der Schulenburg's authority. In witness of this fact, it is them that have requested Germania to make his appointment permanent."
MCW_Scrying_Bulwark: "Scrying Bulwark"
MCW_Scrying_Bulwark_desc: "The military aristocracy of Moskowien is a great mass of contradictions given flesh. In no respect is this more obvious than their Janus-faced view of the territory they now oversee, this “promised land” they fought for ostensibly to liberate it from communism and thus strengthen Germany.\n\nWith the same mouth the average military officer in the Muscovite ruling class will speak of the obvious ruination and hopelessness now evident in the territory after two decades of NSDAP rule and his hopes and dreams, one hundred percent certain to come to fruition, about what he and his colleagues may yet be able to fashion it into. But at the same time, he may be distracted from constantly uttering contradictions in terms by the ever-gnawing certainty that time will have no mercy on him: he and all his colleagues will fade away from this earth soon enough."

MCW_Dance_Of_The_Courtier_desc: "Due to the widespread chaos created by the Vorobyov partisan offensive, the Wehrmacht was incapable of pacifying Moskowien on its own. It was forced, therefore, to rely upon the collaborator organizations represented in the All-Muscovite Congress—the Union of Struggle Against Bolshevism and the People's Socialist Party of Russia—to keep order. This, however, also created an opening for them to expand their own power, a problem that they have now recognized.\n\nThe solution to this problem, in the Wehrmacht's mind, is simple enough: divide and rule. Their strategy to preserve power will now be to move against Oktan, the more powerful and influential of the collaborators, by playing the less powerful Kaminski against him. In theory, this is certainly workable—but its result in practice has yet to be seen."

MCW_Crown_Of_The_False_Son: "Crown of the False Son"
MCW_Crown_Of_The_False_Son_desc: "How unthinkable it must have been to Globocnik and his henchmen on the first of January 1962 that before the end of the decade they would be thrown out and replaced by the collaborators that they had treated as vassals at most. Yet that is precisely what has taken place. Oktan and Kaminski have climbed the pile of skulls from low-level collaborators to become lords over a fiefdom of the outer edges of the empire created by Adolf Hitler.\n\nBut the crown lies unsteadily on the heads of Moskowien's new overlords. The new truce in the land cannot last forever no matter how thickly the champagne flows in the banquet halls. More blood will yet stain what few flagstones are intact in the wasteland of Muscovy, and the question as always is only whose blood it will be."

As a result, what more reason do they need to put their full force into pacifying the region? They take to the task with alacrity, creating an empire of ash.\n\nMoskowien under the brutal rule of the collaborators will become both the worst and the best. From the perspective of orthodox Nazis, it is the worst and most ignominious possible example of failure. But from the perspective of a persistence and perpetuation of lasting Hitlerite tyranny, it is the best possible success—for it represents the naturalization of the national socialist ideology."

When Globocnik, Helldorf, and all the other Germans were sent down in ignominy, the All-Muscovite Congress persisted and carried on with its business. So what if there were no more Germans left to give it orders? Other overlords could be found, and indeed were found in swift order.\n\nWith the rise of Russian collaborators to control over the Reichskommissariat of Moskowien, the All-Muscovite Congress has become a vehicle for their two leading figures—Oktan and Kaminski—to solidify their complete control over the Muscovite State."

Yet again, the Muscovite hydra, still doing the bidding of Judeo-Bolsheviks twenty years after we destroyed the degenerate Soviet Union, has devoured another loyal son of the Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation: Generalkommissar Richard Manderbach of Twer.\n\nA patriot from his adolescence, Richard Manderbach was a Party Comrade of the National Socialist movement from an early stage. After our triumph over the Slavic-communist degeneracy, he went to serve in the Reichskommissariat Ukraine and received accolades for his service.\n\nSubsequently, he was reassigned to the eastern frontier to serve the Führer and the Fatherland, a task to which he took with alacrity. He welcomed his promotion to Generalkommissar in Twer not because it was something he felt "entitled" to but because he wanted to be of greater service to the Reich.\n\nThis service has cost the Generalkommissar of Twer, the most distinguished of our citizens in that colonial region, his life. The perpetrators of this assassination are understood to have been the local Russian terrorists in the Twer region. The office of the Reichskommissar assures us that every effort is being expended to ensure that Party Comrade Manderbach's demise is both avenged and not repeated."

As a result of these privileges, it is accurate to refer to the Congress as the main political body of Russian collaborators in the Reichskommissariat.\n\nA certain steady, reliable rhythm has been established in the months and years since the first meeting of the All-Muscovite Congress. There are two major factions: the Union of Struggle Against Bolshevism, led by Mikhail Oktan, and the People's Socialist Party of Russia under Bronislav Kaminski. These two factions dispute over the correct way for the Russian people to serve their rightful Germanic rulers.\n\nAmidst factional disputations, progress is still made. Anti-partisan proposals and measures are discussed and planned, subject to approval by Reichskommissar Globocnik. Promises to the Russian people—the offer of submission to the Greater Germanic Reich—are repeated, as they have always been.\n\nAnother subject of note are speeches given at varying intervals during the All-Muscovite Congress. As has been the case since the establishment of the Congress, the speeches are on the same elevated and correct topics. They praise the greatness of the Führer, the beauty of the Europe that he has created, and the need to continue combat against Judeo-Bolshevism. So it has always been, so will it remain."
