Following the defeat of the Allies in the Second World War, Britain's Antarctic claim was up for grabs, and several years later, Argentina tried to do just that. They also attempted to declare sovereignty over several small islands which held now-defunct British stations, that were within the region claimed by Chile. The Chileans raised a diplomatic dispute, the United States got involved, and the Scramble for Antarctica began.\n\nFollowing the negotiations, Argentina received all but the very western part of their claimed lands. With the territory secure, Argentina opened the land for international scientific discovery and research, a practice that it has continued to this day.

Reichskommissariat Norwegen relinquished its Antarctic claim to the Germans, who then consolidated the territory into the present administration.
