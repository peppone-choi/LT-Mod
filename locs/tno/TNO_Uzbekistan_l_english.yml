 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_FAYZULLA_KHODZHAYEV_DESC: "It is impossible to describe the human spirit or to give it a solid, cohesive definition. Identifying what makes humanity wake up in the morning to work away at its doings is difficult beyond comprehension, as there is a limitless pool of definitions of what persuades the individual to work and live their life. Not one of these definitions can be found in the hearts or minds of any living soul in Uzbekistan.\n\nAbandoned, ignored, and humiliated would be the only way to describe the minds of those within the Uzbekistani state, as the Central Asian War, the collapse of the USSR time and time again, and the backwards state which the nation has been left in have all taken their toll on the national psyche and even culture of Uzbekistan. This mindset is expressed better by none other than the premier of Uzbekistan; Fayzulla Khodzhayev.\n\nOnce an idealistic member of the Uzbek Communist Party, Uzbekistan's limited contributions from the USSR in favor of the varied other Soviet Republics had already left it desolate, though his faith would only falter further until receiving its deathblow when the West Russian Revolutionary Front was crushed forever. Since then, the increasingly apathetic state of the government has solidified and has only crawled further into a worsening state.\n\nToday, Uzbekistan sits quietly in Central Asia, allowing for its cynicism crisis to worsen further and further. With little hope for the Uzbekistani people beyond a silent, apathetic future, nothing can be done for Uzbekistan.\n\nNothing beyond the people causing the future themselves."
 POLITICS_ISLAM_KARIMOV_DESC: "The lower bowels of the Uzbekistani political scene are one saturated with the party politics and power struggles that would seem more at home in the United States of America rather than a state smack dab in the middle of Central Asia. Even still, there is no greater product of this chaotic state of affairs than Islam Karimov, President of Uzbekistan and puppet of the Jadidi.\n\nBorn into a troubled life between an Uzbek and a Tajik, Karimov spent much of his youth in an orphanage, though decided to follow the path which his parents had blazed- that of a civil servant. Throughout his youth, Karimov could not help but look to the disasters which befell Uzbekistan, the broken world in which he grew up. He could not claim to remember the day that the USSR fell, nor can he claim to have been on the frontlines of the West Russian War, Karimov can claim to want the best for Uzbekistan. Even still, with the Jadidi holding most all the legitimate power in the government, Karimov can only do so much for his country and vows to one day make change for his world.\n\nNo matter how long it takes to get there."

 ### Ideas ###
 UZB_The_Oligarchy: "The Oligarchy"
 UZB_The_Oligarchy_desc: "Connected by large webs of familial alliances and government positions, Uzbekistan's oligarchs have managed to possess and centralize a large percentage of the country's total wealth into their own hands. While Central Asia is no stranger to oligarchs, Uzbekistan's unique situation has allowed them to not only assert themselves as the upper echelon of society, but also as figures who held large influence within the bureaucracy.\n\nThese two facts combined mean that not only is the wealth disparity within the country massive, but also that the government is ineffective as corruption is rampant, with officials directing funds into their own accounts."
 UZB_Jadid: "Jadid"
 UZB_Jadid_desc: "Since the days of the October Revolution, Jadidist thought has proliferated across Uzbekistan, with some of the earliest revolutionaries being the strongest advocates of the socialist branch of Jadidism. Now, however, with the failings of socialism demonstrated clearly by the end of Bukharin's regime, the other side of Jadidism has come to light. That of inspiration from the Western age of enlightenment, and the proliferation of hope for an Islamic age of enlightenment, all under a Western-style democracy.\n\nWith such promises of a better future and such firm roots in Uzbekistan as a whole, the ideology has become nothing short of a considerable force in Uzbekistani culture, influencing art forms, literature, and even fashion. Whether these promises of a brighter future can be achieved, however, remain up in the air at best."
 UZB_Rise_of_Discontent: "Rise of Discontent"
 UZB_Rise_of_Discontent_desc: "While Jadidism is a greatly influential factor in Uzbekistani life, there remains a doubt among those whom it affects. As the ideology has been a part of life since the days of the USSR -in one form or another- faith in the belief has been shaken to its core, as the fall of the USSR, the fall of the WRRF, and the ongoing desolate state of Central Asia has provided nothing but ammunition for those who would claim that Jadidism is nothing but a ploy manipulating Islam for power.\n\nMuch remains to be seen if these claims are true, but if they are, it will spell doom for the ruling government, and the stability of Uzbekistan will surely suffer for it."
