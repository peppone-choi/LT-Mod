 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_JIGME_DORJI_WANGCHUCK_DESC: "Jigme Dorji Wangchuck became King of Bhutan in 1952, leading his country through an era of shifting tides. Born in the Thruepang palace in 1928, he was educated in Kalimpong and Simla, witnessing the growing influence of post-war Japan in Asia. These experiences formed his vision for reform in Bhutan, while preserving traditions. Wangchuck faced a divided court and carefully navigated tensions between reformists and conservatives, sympathizing with moderate reforms like democratization and economic modernization, but resisting radical changes that could threaten the monarchy. The creation of a national assembly in 1953 allowed for greater public involvement, while maintaining final authority with the king.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Bhutan took its first steps towards modernization under Wangchuk's leadership, focusing on building the fundamental infrastructure of the country. With assistance from Kolkata, initial roads were built to link key areas, basic healthcare facilities were set up, and education started expanding beyond traditional monastic teaching. Early moves to abolish bonded labour and introduce more equitable taxation highlighted his commitment to social progress.\n\nDespite these advancements, Wangchuck remains vigilant about protecting Bhutan’s sovereignty in a region dominated by the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Balancing tradition with modernization, his reign continues to shape Bhutan’s transformation into a respected nation, firmly rooted in its identity while adapting to a changing world."

 BHU_The_Dilemma_Of_Reform: "The Dilemma of Reform"
 BHU_The_Dilemma_Of_Reform_desc: "Within the court, a battle rages between the conservative and more reform-minded figures. Within the reformists is also a conflict on the extent of said reform, with some arguing for only token change and others fighting for complete turn of the economy and further democratization.\n\nKing Wangchuck is more sympathetic toward the reformists, but is still wary of the radicals, fearing they strip too much of his power. On the other end, the Aristocracy benefitting from the old, and the ever-important pillar of the armed forces. We traverse a minefield, with any misstep sending our country into crisis."

 BHU_In_Kolkatas_Shadow: "In Kolkata’s Shadow"
 BHU_In_Kolkatas_Shadow_desc: "Bhutan stands at a crossroads. A nation balancing its deep traditions with the pressures of a modernizing world, officially a sovereign kingdom. Bhutan's foreign policy remains firmly under the aegis of Azad Hind, whose guiding hand has been instrumental in preserving the nation's stability while steering its cautious steps onto the global stage.\n\nUnder the guidance of Kolkata, Bhutan has made strides towards modernization. Roads snake through the once-impenetrable mountains, connecting remote villages to the capital, Thimphu. Modern schools and hospitals, built with Japanese expertise, dot the landscape, offering Bhutanese people a glimpse into 20th-century promises. Yet this growth brings with it quiet tension: How far can a nation modernize without losing its identity?"
