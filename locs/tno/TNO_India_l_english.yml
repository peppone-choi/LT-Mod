 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC: "Born to a privileged family already involved in the independence struggle, Jawaharlal Nehru experienced India and its traditions almost as an outsider - after completing an English education at the heart of the British Empire and only then returning home. Nevertheless, participating in the Congress' independence struggle at the right-hand side of the Mahatma himself brought him popular support and leadership positions - so that when the British Raj finally collapsed ignominiously in 1943 he was right there to take up the reins.\n\nBut this leadership was not only his own. Caught between an expansionist Afghanistan in the west, the Japanese threat encroaching in from the east, and the princes at home jockeying for separate independence, Nehru chose instead to compromise his own power for the sake of the nation, inviting Subhas Bose and the INA to form a joint government for the sake of maintaining India's territorial sanctity. An alliance that would not last, and with the failures of the war against Afghanistan the only other option was to cut off his erstwhile friend and ally and watch as he escaped to the East, forming a bitter rival government in Kolkata.\n\nNow only governing half a country, Nehru nevertheless sought to build the India of his and the rest of Congress' vision - a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic free from the authoritarianism that plagued other postcolonial states. For two decades he laboured as Prime Minister in this endeavour - but now it seems his time is coming to a close. Perhaps he will not be able to settle things and see a united India in his own lifetime. But his legacy - for India's sake - must persevere."
 POLITICS_VK_KRISHNA_MENON_DESC: "Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon is a man embodying the contractions and contrasts of an independent India. Born into privilege, Menon was educated in economics, psychology, and law amongst a star-studded cast of peers and Labour party comrades in interwar London.\n\nAll this came to an abrupt end in February of 1943, when at the advice of Nehru he made the risky journey home on board a British submarine - amusingly, in waters where another Indian also left Europe. Two months later, that world in London collapsed entirely, and a new one dawned in New Delhi.\n\nThroughout his political career, Menon adhered to three basic principles - fierce non-alignment on the world stage, fierce loyalty to Nehru, and general ferocity to anyone opposed to him. This has won him the seething enmity of the West, the watchful distrust of the East, and begrudging admiration from his peers. Now, with the great man gone and his last wishes made explicit, Menon has risen to the highest office in the land by acclamation of his Party. Rumours abound, however, that as always he will chart his own path..."
 POLITICS_VK_KRISHNA_MENON_DURING_DESC: "Amidst a flurry of activity in Lucknow, V.K. Krishna Menon, Prime Minister of the Republic of India, has done the seemingly impossible and reconciled the two rival governments of the subcontinent. While it remains to be seen if this new union will hold long enough to truly be cemented - and if Menon's famously abrasive personality will clash with his counterpart's equally famous obstinacy - the common people of the country celebrate as war has been seemingly averted."
 POLITICS_VK_KRISHNA_MENON_POST_DESC: "Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon is a man embodying the contractions and contrasts of an independent India. Born into privilege, Menon was educated in economics, psychology, and law amongst a star-studded cast of peers and Labour party comrades in interwar London.\n\nDespite that world having long since crumbled, the Prime Minister has built a new one in the ashes of the British Raj. The spectre of war has been averted, and Congress has been forced to recognize both his immense popularity with the people and the tangible accomplishment of unity. Almost immediately, the new India has charted a fiercely independent path, renegotiating treaties with Japan and rebuffing relations with the OFN, whilst eagerly seeking connections with the lesser nations of the world.\n\nHolding a nearly unlimited mandate and with a blank check from the Party, the world anxiously awaits how Menon will build on his predecessor's legacy."
 POLITICS_LAL_BAHADUR_SHASTRI_DESC: "Rising to office in the chaotic aftermath of the disastrous Lucknow Conference, Lal Bahadur Shastri knows his candidacy represents the Indian people's final chance given to Nehruvian socialism. Only in the face of the clear majority he would still be able to command in the General Election did Moraji Desai back off, and this only represents the first of mounting challenges Shastri faces.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in Ramnagar, Shastri ascended the ranks of Congress with diligent effort and a staunch loyalty first to Gandhi, and then to Nehru. His efforts in building ties across Uttar Pradesh during his various ministries have culminated in a somewhat neutered Pakistan Movement and a powerful network of allies, proteges, and contacts through which government schemes might be more effectively enacted. All of this, however, exists in the twin shadows of the two demons which he now faces - war and famine. In the face of such immeasurable odds, Shastri turns to one slogan:\n\nJai Jawan, Jai Kisan. Only with these two victories can his beloved nation survive."
 POLITICS_YASHVANTRAO_CHAVAN_DESC: "The candidacy of Yashwantrao Chavan represents the fervent desire of the Indian voter to return to some form of normalcy, after the chaos of the sixties. Alone amongst the cast of fiery orators, opinionated thinkers, and dangerous extremists, Chavan stands as an experienced administrator determined to chart the Nehruvian course with as little chaos as possible.\n\nBorn in Satara district in the determinedly Marathi-speaking half of Bombay, Yashvantrao Chavan followed a similar path as many other Indian politicians of his generation - taking part in the independence movement, rising in the local ranks of Congress, and acquiring experience with a ministerial position or two. Or three. Or in his case, almost every single one - from Chief Minister, to Defence, External Affairs, and now finally the highest office of them all. With this experience he brings a sense of stability to a ship that has been buffeted around like no other by the choppy waters of the previous decade - waters he intends to calm."
 POLITICS_CHARAN_SINGH_DESC: "The transition of power from a historic party with a clear message to an uneasy coalition organised mostly around opposition to the ruling party has not been easy, and Charan Singh knows the ground beneath his feet is shifting and uncertain. However, as a farmer, he also knows how to tend that ground far better than the shifty politicians surrounding him - and in particular, how to reap its rewards.\n\nUnlike many other senior Indian politicians who have bounced between states and positions, throughout his career Singh has remained steadfastly in the heartland of Uttar Pradesh, championing the cause of farmers against the twin demons of land theft in the form of cooperatives, and the endless greed of traders and speculators. His new ascension as the leader of the anti-establishment opposition has not blunted this zeal for his people, and though coalition partners will throw their myriad demands in his face, there is only ever one cause he will truly care for."
 POLITICS_MORARJI_DESAI_DESC: "Moraji Desai is a man who has remained in the shadows of both public life and Congress his whole life, yearning for the light. Alongside his peers, he fought during the struggle for freedom alongside Gandhi and Congress, alongside taking top positions in the Bombay government during the elections of 1937.\n\nHowever, as Nehru, Bose, and other socialist personalities rose dramatically in the collapse of the Raj, conservative advocates for a freer market found themselves sidelined. Desai nevertheless staunchly held his ground, growing ever more popular within Congress against the backdrop of the New Order being enacted around India, and with the collapse of Menon's misguided efforts to reach out to the madman in the East, he has finally risen to the top.\n\nDesai holds no loyalty to the ideology which saw only collapse and fracture in Russia, whilst its opponents have seen nothing but success. Nor is he beholden to nonsensical ideas of non-alignment at a time when conflicts are inevitable. The path forward is clear, and he will march fearlessly on."
 POLITICS_CHAKRAVARTI_RAJAGOPALACHARI_DESC: "Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, known simply as Rajaji, is a man that has emerged from the shadows of grey eminence to take the centre stage of politics in a dramatic fashion quite at odds with his age.\n\nBorn a sickly child in Madras in the year 1878 - only twenty-one years after the First War of Independence - Rajaji participated in the independence movement right from its inception. From joining in 1906, to breaking the salt laws of the Raj, at every historic moment when the British grasp on India was forced to loosen he was present. In the chaotic days following the creation of the unity government, Rajaji abstained from taking office - only to then rejoin Nehru's emergency Cabinet in the aftermath of the war in Afghanistan. Shortly after, he returned to the political wilderness outside the INC, steadily building up his classically liberal alternative. And now, near the end of a long, long life, he has succeeded, if at nothing else, of doing the impossible and ousting Congress."
 POLITICS_NG_RANGA_DESC: "They say those who know the flaws of a cause best are those that were driven from its embrace, and N.G. Ranga stands as a prime example.\n\nBorn in the Telugu-speaking parts of Madras State, Ranga was educated at Oxford and went from mild flirtations with socialism to an outright embrace of Marxism upon seeing the giant strides made by Bukharin and his ilk. This summer romance quickly turned sour, however, upon actually visiting the USSR - and proved to be correct when the German jackboot smashed the rotten structure entirely. Upon his return to India, Ranga participated in the freedom struggle and entered post-Independence politics as a firm advocate of individual liberties and peasant rights in opposition to the bureaucratic Nehruvian machine. Now, as Rajaji's successor, the time has finally arrived to correct the course and ensure freedom remains the watchword of the Indian democracy."
 POLITICS_GAYATRI_DEVI_DESC: "In some ways, Maharani Gayatri Devi (the title being purely courtesy, of course) was born to rule. As the consort of the Maharaja Man Singh II, and a beautiful princess in her own right, Devi represents the 'other half' of the Swatantra Party - the millions of displaced royals, landowners, and zamindars ejected unceremoniously by the independence movement.\n\nHowever, her lot is not simply cast in with them. Elected democratically as the Member of Parliament for Jaipur, Devi's candidacy is remarked by some to be the manifestation of a new era of 'charismatic politicians', such as former royals, movie stars, and religious leaders - convenient faces without much ideological strength. However, behind the unflappable facade of royalty, her Highness - and now Excellency - fully intends to bring the transformation brought about by the Swatantra party to its conclusion. "

 IND_Looming_Communal_Problem: "Looming Communal Problem"
 IND_Looming_Communal_Problem_desc: "The incomplete Afghan War and failure of the government to address the Pakistan Movement have left millions of people across regions of both Muslim majority and minority uncertain about their security and livelihood. With the death of Gandhi the last resort has been lost - should communal violence break out again it will be bloodier and more uncontrollable than ever before."
 IND_Neverending_Security_Budget: "Neverending Security Budget"
 IND_Neverending_Security_Budget_desc: "The possibility of war with the East has forced the government to divert a considerable amount of the budget for military purposes, hamstringing vital and dearly needed social programs and subsidies. Until a permanent solution for this can be found we will not be able to significantly improve material conditions among the people."
 IND_Third_Five_Year_Plan: "Third Five Year Plan"
 IND_Third_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "The Third Five-Year Plan continues the focus on electrification, rapid industrialization and agricultural investments from the previous Plan, but with a much greater emphasis on the development of a domestic military-industrial base."

 IND_Stroke_Of_The_Midnight_Hour: "Stroke of the Midnight Hour"
 IND_Stroke_Of_The_Midnight_Hour_desc: "26th January 1943 should have been a glorious time for the suffering masses of the Indian subcontinent, freed from the heavy yoke of imperialism. Instead, for twenty years since, the country has remained stillborn and trapped under the sword of Damocles. The need to maintain internal security has resulted in an ossified democracy supported by the iron pillar of Nehru's personal popularity, and propagated by party stalwarts urging national unity. However, cracks are beginning to show in the political landscape, and if Panditji himself were to fall ill..."
 IND_A_Civilian_Economy_For_The_Army: "A Civilian Economy, For the Army"
 IND_A_Civilian_Economy_For_The_Army_desc: "Building from the industrial base created from the first two Plans, the present Indian economy continues to emphasise electrification and import-substitution industrialisation on the basis of government quotas. However, the drive to maintain war preparedness has created a gap between consumer needs and actual implementation, with light industries receiving far fewer resources than heavy ones. This has created a black market for the secretive import of consumer products from all over the world and is systematically draining the national coffers - but how can we throw down our guns when we need them the most?"
 IND_Shadows_Of_Communalism: "Shadows of Communalism"
 IND_Shadows_Of_Communalism_desc: "The incomplete Afghan War and fears of a Hindu-dominated political scene have left millions of people across regions of both Muslim majority and minority uncertain about their security and livelihood. The Pakistan Movement was never fully addressed and rumours of secret infiltrators abound - should communal violence break out again it will be bloodier and more uncontrollable than ever before. Worse still, across the remnants of the Durand Line, old enemies lay waiting - hunting for the opportune moment to strike when we are weakest. "
 IND_Beacon_In_The_Dark: "Beacon in the Dark"
 IND_Beacon_In_The_Dark_desc: "Across the Asian continent, hundreds of millions suffer under the withering glare of the Rising Sun and their lackey governments, content to sell off their own for personal gain. The Republic stands alone as a beacon of hope for sovereign, democratic rule by the people, for the people, and of the people. Despite everything else, this is still a promise that echoes determinately in the ears of farmers, soldiers, and workers alike - and it means that any push in either direction towards authoritarianism will be regarded with the utmost suspicion."
 IND_Going_It_Alone: "Going it Alone"
 IND_Going_It_Alone_desc: "Despite the lapdogs in the East having acceeded to foreign influence, we cannot as responsible stewards of the state allow the same to happen to us, even at the risk of losing out on military and industrial aid. Nehruvian foreign policy has emphasised remaining equidistant from all three superpowers - including the United States, which shares our democratic principles - and firebrands in the Congress have proposed taking this further and embracing a new Non-Aligned Movement to unify the precious few independent nations against encroachment from the Big Three. For the time being however, this means we walk a precarious and lonely road forward into modernity - and one beset by enemies we must deal with one way or another."
 IND_Tryst_With_Destiny: "Tryst With Destiny"
 IND_Tryst_With_Destiny_desc: "As Washington and Tokyo alike watch with growing irritation, the will of millions to avoid slaughtering their kin has manifested in an unprecedented series of actions led by both Indias' leadership. The border is still fresh - the wound can still be healed. By offering a series of concessions to the Eastern government, including political representation for the HSS and economic reintegration, Menon has triggered a surge of reciprocal goodwill from Kolkata - but consternation from some within his own party."
 IND_Cry_Havoc: "Cry Havoc"
 IND_Cry_Havoc_desc: "[GetCryHavocDesc]"
 IND_Cry_Havoc_prep: "A breaking point has been reached, and peace is only a dead word on the lips of craven sycophants. With the enthusiasm of a people united as one, workers pour into the factories churning out bullets, shells, and guns at breakneck pace. Generals draft plans and soldiers drill, relentlessly imagining the face of their enemy in the mirror. The world is transient, filled with dying things, and we will render it into bloodied dust."
 IND_Cry_Havoc_war: "The cities are quiet, the villages are empty. The horizon echoes with the dull rumble of bombs rendering the earth asunder and armies marching to slaughter everything in their wake. Red rivers flow from the battlefield as shrapnel turns men into hideous creatures crawling on stumps crying uselessly for aid. The dogs of war have been let loose, and until their baying is choked out under mud and blood they will rip and tear a terrible gash into the tear-streaked bosom of Mother India."
 IND_Death_March_Downwards: "Death March Downwards"
 IND_Death_March_Downwards_desc: "The numbers keep rising. More bullets are spat out from the factories straight to the front lines. More shells fall like the monsoon rains. More bodies pile up in new mountains casting shadows over the Himalayas themselves. We are the damned, marching into the abyss with precise, rhythmic steps, and we will not stop until the Lord of Death himself lays bayoneted at our feet and his justice seized for our masters. "
 IND_Embers_Of_Communalism: "Embers of Communalism"
 IND_Embers_Of_Communalism_desc: "Whispers from the shadows have turned into rumours shared between housewives. Rumours of secret cow slaughter and forced marriages, of mosques being closed and unexplained job loss. Communities once at peace with their neighbours now lock their doors and peer from between window slits at the devil they know - or thought they knew. Meanwhile, intelligence agencies note money and propaganda insidiously snaking inside from foreign lands - in particular, from an erstwhile foe hiding in the mountains..."
 IND_Indias_Long_Night: "India's Long Night"
 IND_Indias_Long_Night_desc: "The worker takes extra hours to ensure enough bullets reach the front line. The farmer exhorts his sons to take up arms and defeat the vile monsters across the border. The young radicals and the government's newspapers all shout in bold letters of the necessity of war, the glory of sacrifice, and the suspension of due process for a good cause. A light is flickering and dimming, and a select few educated men sitting in their ivory towers whisper, when no one else listens, of how it may not rekindle again."
 IND_Friend_In_Need: "Friend in Need"
 IND_Friend_In_Need_desc: "Any thoughts of non-alignment and realpolitik have been left in the dust of the Eastern blitz. Indo-American cooperation has reached an all-time high, as millions of dollars of equipment, aid, and technical advisors come streaming in from the city on a hill to help democracy hang on for dear life. That being said, when the dust settles on this war too, those millions of dollars and all those advisors will still be here, waiting..."
 IND_Indian_Economic_Union: "Indian Economic Union"
 IND_Indian_Economic_Union_desc: "The first step of unification - economic - has begun. With the Azad Hind rupee allowed to convert district by district into the Republican, the government in Kolkata works with the utmost caution to avoid a sudden catastrophe and thus grant the initiative to Delhi.

 IND_The_Behemoth_Menon_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success.\n\nHowever, the newly unified government now finds itself with the additional challenge of re-imposing the civil bureaucracy into the East, formerly governed by HSS party organs. Aspiring young IAS cadres find themselves between imposing figures from Delhi and distrustful citizens on the ground - and have to pick a side."
 IND_The_Behemoth_Bose: "The Behemoth"
 IND_The_Behemoth_Bose_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success.\n\nHowever, the newly unified government finds itself transforming and morphing with every passing day, mesmerising the people into compliance. The model of governance via HSS party organs is slowly and insidiously merging with the Indian Administrative Service, as IAS cadres work hand-in-hand with local party bodies."
 IND_The_Behemoth_ROI_1: "The Behemoth"
 IND_The_Behemoth_ROI_1_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success. With Indira Gandhi in power, the edifice can be transformed, and individual needs and ambitions shall be directed towards the national interest.\n\nPower shall be centralised in the union government, with a corporatist structure and expanded bureaucracy in place to support state power over the economy. While electoral processes are respected, covert favour towards the INC is provided to ensure stability in government, guaranteeing a mandate and continuity of staff to implement a long-term vision. When peace and prosperity are on the line, the new government will not suffer any threat to their control."
 IND_The_Behemoth_ROI_2: "The Behemoth"
 IND_The_Behemoth_ROI_2_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success. It is the will of the Goddess Durga that this petty ambition is broken and all efforts are directed towards the national interest. With the declaration of The Emergency, the edifice can now be reshaped and reinforced towards that end.\n\nEconomic decrees from the union government, backed by a sprawling bureaucracy and the firm hand of security forces, keep labour and capital motivated towards prosperity. Trade unions who hold back progress are suppressed. Electoral processes range from tightly controlled to suspended. The loyal shall be rewarded with economic security. The discipline of the graveyard will handle the rest."
 IND_The_Behemoth_ROI_Ram: "The Behemoth"
 IND_The_Behemoth_ROI_Ram_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success. Despite the attempts to reshape this edifice by the Indian National Congress, which still commands a majority in the legislature, the people have rejected these attempts and given the All-India Janata Front a mandate to alleviate the worst excesses of the previous government.\n\nThe Front is a big tent, united in common beliefs: the necessity of returning to agrarian populism, back towards supporting homesteaders and sharecroppers, back towards a government that benefits the people. But a dozen hands hold the reins, and it will take great willpower to convince them all to pull them towards the same direction."

The Party-State has not been fully rebuilt, however, and the real work can finally begin - even as shadowy figures lurk in the darkness, and the looming onset of Netaji's demise presents an opportunity the HSS would rather not see..."

 IND_The_Behemoth_AH_2_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success.\n\nNow, the newly unified government has remade the nation in its image and fended off the would-be Bonapartists seeking to destroy her. The Party-State will be rebuilt in the memory of her greatest champion, and India forced into modernity for her own sake. The East and West are a hundred years ahead of us - we will make this gap in ten."

 IND_The_Behemoth_Coup_1_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success.\n\nWillingly destroying the legacy of the apolitical Indian soldier, the Army has taken matters into its own hands to stop the perversion of the HSS from corrupting the nation further. Door after door is battered down, as HSS-aligned officers face court-martials or simply “disappear” in the night. As the nation sits suspended in emergency and still grieving the lost Netaji, only time will tell if the generals truly seek to repair the nation or whether they find the weight of a crown as comfortable as a gun."
 IND_The_Behemoth_Coup_2: "The Behemoth"
 IND_The_Behemoth_Coup_2_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success.\n\nA newly reforged political system gleams uneasily in Delhi, crafted by the rough hands of soldiers. In clear imitation of the politics of her erstwhile master, the Swatantra party dresses in the skin of the Tories while the new 'Indian Labour Party' cobbles together what Nehruvians remained clear of the Army's gaze. As the life leaves India's political system, the eyes of the masses have been darkened by disillusion - and no inspiration, or truth, will ever be found in the military's parliamentary facade."

 IND_The_Behemoth_Yadav_desc: "The Republic of India is a gigantic edifice that seeks to govern nearly half a billion people across millions of villages, towns, and cities, all seeking their own success.\n\nThe Swatantara government was a failure unlike any other in the still-young history of India's democracy, one that had forsaken any semblance of loyalty to the people of India and in so doing, shattered the faith of millions upon millions of Indians in the democratic process that their forefathers had fought and bled for over a century, only to be left with little to show for it but resentment and apathy.\n\nThe new government of Brahm Prakash Yadav has the unenviable task of fixing the damage, but they may yet have the means to achieve it. Yadav's initiatives to appeal to India's disillusioned middle class have the potential to breathe life back into India's parliamentary process, taking the fight to the ruling elites that abandoned them at the ballot box and shining a light on most Indians' standards of living."

 IND_The_Nations_Honeymoon_desc: "After a generation of bitter enmity and mutual paranoia, the ruling establishments of both the Republic of India and the Azad Hind have succeeded in reuniting the subcontinent as it was before the Second World War. The INC and HSS have agreed to honor their shared commitments to the people of India, even at the risk of potentially alienating their backers in Washington and Tokyo. The seedlings of a united and independent India, planted in the mud at Passchendaele, watered in the monsoons of the Burma Campaign and finally taking root between the cracks of the new order, India looks upon a hopeful future earned through more than a century's worth of sacrifice.\n\nYet the story of India is not over. Even as a hopeful optimism casts a new light on India's prospects, the specter of the Cold War is far from invisible. The INC and HSS still have plenty of disagreements over the specifics for the future of India, just as dueling OFN and GEACPS interests in the region are sure to force their influence into either camp. The newly reunified state of India can indeed enjoy the moment of their well-earned triumph, but how long can hope and optimism hold out before the shifting tides of the Cold War whim their way back to India's shores?"

 IND_Whispers_of_Communalism_desc: "The Pakistan Movement was a tinderbox waiting for a spark to set if off, but with the success of the Lucknow Conference, it appears that it will never become a reality. The dreams of a separate Islamic state have now faded away from the mainstream, as national unity rules the day in its wake.\n\nWhile many true believers lament the failed birth of Pakistan, most Muslims are able to take solace in the fact that the newly-unified India has become a nation now more tolerant to religions outside of Hinduism, owing to the added representation of these religious minorities. Communal tensions may still remain, but the problems they pose no longer seem as insurmountable as they did when India was divided."

 IND_Non_Alignment_with_Indian_Characteristics_desc: "The newly unified Indian state has, officially, withdrawn its membership of the Co-Prosperity Sphere - an unprecedented action for Tokyo to not respond to. However, behind closed doors, Japanese politicians always have an ear waiting to listen to them. The IJA and IJN find no rebels harboured, and no cooperation fully refused. Delhi may call itself non-aligned, and most of the world agrees. But some note that not much Sphere policy has changed in response to this apparently seismic shift."
 IND_The_Twenty_Point_Programme: "The Twenty Point Programme"
 IND_The_Twenty_Point_Programme_desc: "A series of economic reforms implemented since Indira Gandhi ascended to power, these points represent a major shift away from her father's economic plans. Whilst combatting rural poverty remains an aim, it has been deprioiritised in favour of pursuing the construction of housing, irrigation and electrification. Beyond preserving current progress, land redistribution has also been moved away from, and no further advances are to be pursued on this front.\n\nHowever, this is not a total repudiation of established economic orthodoxy within India. Economic planning remains a cornerstone of the state, and will doubtlessly remain pursued. The Indian economy will be restructured along a corporatist model under Gandhi's lead, with the formation of a number of bodies directed towards these ends."

Left in dire financial straits, they and many others have turned to the new HSS government for assistance, who in turn has promised to repair and revitalize the old system.\n\nThe HSS has promised to bring the planned economy not just to Bengal again, but to all of India. Critics have accused the government of being dangerously irresponsible by setting out this mission, citing the extreme costs of extending this mode across the nation and protesting the damage it will do to the West Indian economy. However, these protests have fallen on deaf ears as the government prepares to free India for a second time..."

In its place is a much sturdier foundation: the twin pillars of enlightened liberal figures and the firm hand of the military. They will ensure that the world's largest democracy is carefully guided to prevent any further ruin from befalling India. So long as its people remain susceptible to siren songs and petty promises from populists and demagogues, it falls to men of rationality and foresight to protect the unenlightened masses from their own weaknesses."
 IND_The_Finished_Puzzle: "The Finished Puzzle"
 IND_The_Finished_Puzzle_desc: "The once-shattered pieces of the old planned economy have now been neatly put back together, roaring back to life as a powerful force in the Asian marketplace. New land reform programs set out to destroy every last trace of the zamindar system in the West, as poverty and homelessness soon become relics of the past. For most, India has never had it quite this good.\n\nThe price for this end to inequality is the end of the Republic's democracy, smothered under the rebirthed HSS party-state. However, the vast majority of Indians do not seem particularly perturbed over this disruption to their freedom, preferring instead the economic luxuries gained in the drive for development. As expansion continues, democracy fades away as a failed experiment, a system unfit for India."

Economic control has been returned to those men who steward their own lands, from both their estates at home and the Parliament in New Delhi. As the nation faces mounting crises, including rising malnutrition in poorer territories, the skyrocketing economic growth created by these new policies gives the government the means to combat these new threats to stability and order."

Along this wind travel investment offers and defence contracts, partnerships and promises, opportunities for the American government and American businesses in the world's largest democracy.\n\nIndia has opened itself to American businesses with unprecedented access. Government and business leaders claim this is a natural alliance—the inevitable union of liberal democracies and liberal markets, working together to develop and strengthen the free world. Yet rumours of American support for the current government stretch back as far as the coup which brought Masani to power against the HSS. If the rumours are true, perhaps this support is less of a fated alignment and more a debt that can never be fulfilled."
 IND_The_Dimming_Light: "The Dimming Light"
 IND_The_Dimming_Light_desc: "From Delhi to Bombay to Kolkata, the children of India look upon an ominous sky, on the shortly setting sun of India's burgeoning democracy. With the government's use of force in suppressing their political rivals, press outlets, and independent journalists increasingly fearful of state-enforced censorship and a regime growing virulently intolerant of public dissent, it does not take a political scholar to recognize that nascent authoritarianism in India has the very real threat of ending the democratic process, perhaps permanently.\n\nWhile India's democracy is by no means dead yet, as a defiant cadre of patriotic parliamentarians stands ready to defend their institutions if the state continues down its increasingly despotic course, it might not be long before the Republic of India slips beneath the waves to join Great Britain as yet another victim of reactionary politics."
 IND_Back_to_Basics: "Back to Basics"
 IND_Back_to_Basics_desc: "Nowhere is Jagijvan Ram's distinctions from Gandhi more evident than in his repudiation of corporatism, now being gutted into a handful of transitional bodies. Rather than prioritising several goals, Ram has only prioritised the direct fight against rural poverty. Programmes for the electrification of settlements and protection and expansion of yields are a cornerstone, whilst rationing ensures that all Indian peasants will be able to access at least one square meal a per day.\n\nHis economic policy is hampered. Corruption limits the degree to which wealth is genuinely redistributed, infighting limits the focus for any legislation introduced, and his alliance with larger landowners in rural areas will serve as a final blow to land redistribution. Nonetheless, welfare and aid will continue to trickle, in some form, through to the farms that stretch across much of the subcontinent."

Civil authority is breaking down with every passing moment, and the enemy's watchful eyes gleam greedily as they see the fruits of their work."

 IND_An_India_of_Light_desc: "The war has been won, and to the victor goes the spoils. As the rest of the nation slowly begins returning to normalcy - or the post-war definition thereof - the East remains firmly in the grasp of the Reconstruction Authority. Party stalwarts control their petty fiefdoms almost like the zamindars and princes of the past, dispensing law and justice as they see fit. Was this what we fought to preserve?"

 IND_Reversing_the_Overreach: "Reversing the Overreach"
 IND_Reversing_the_Overreach_desc: "The pruner has been released. Now ascendant, the right-wing of the INC has gotten to work, sorting through the myriad of economic powers that they have accrued over the past two decades. From Nehru to Chevan, New Delhi has attained a number of powers over the state's economy, but has only managed to oversee its decline. Under their behest, India will see a deregulation and reduction of economic powers, a drastic step as its powers are pruned and thinned.\n\nFew avenues of public life will be left untouched by this. Land reform will be effectively halted, and any further redistribution stopped. Welfare programmes will be curtailed, deemed a wasteful excess. Nationalisation programmes will be maintained, but no further efforts to privatise the economy will be initiated. These changes are drastic shifts, perhaps, but so are the failures of Nehruvian socialism."

 IND_Kulak_Socialism_desc: "For far too long, the Indian government has focused on supporting the renter class with little concern for the rentee, left to toil away in fields without a chance for social mobility. That day has now ended with the election of a government by and for the middle peasantry. Prime Minister Charan Singh has pledged a raft of measures designed to assist and protect India's ignored middle class.\n\nThe days of the zamindar's reign are over, but so are the days of overt paternalism toward the lower peasantry. Instead, the state will focus on uplifting the petty proprietors of farming to reach new economic boons through economic intervention, providing cheap loans, technical expertise, and plentiful subsidies. While some believe this will only increase India's inequality by widening the gap between the lower and middle peasantry, Singh knows that this rising tide will surely lift all boats."
 IND_The_Indian_Vision: "The Indian Vision"
 IND_The_Indian_Vision_desc: "An east wind has blown throughout the nation, cold and bitter, but we have weathered it and emerged for the better. The government has launched striking economic reforms, aiming to stimulate entrepreneurship and emphasising partnership between domestic firms and multinational megacorporations by offering tax incentives, cheap labour, and reduced oversight. However, the reins of power still remain firmly in Delhi, and the Planning Commission remains paramount as far as decisionmaking goes."

The government has dissolved the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Economic Forum. With the restraints pulled off and credit lines pumping in, domestic giants expand at breakneck pace while foreign companies enter the market wholesale and either partner up or compete directly. One thing is certain - India's huddled masses are beginning to enter the emerging global economy centred on the OFN."

India has joined the OFN, with hundreds of American soldiers arriving at Bombay every day establishing bases, forward recon centres, and stimulating the economy even as Tokyo plots its revenge.

 IND_Reversing_the_Current: "Reversing the Current"
 IND_Reversing_the_Current_desc: "The Swatantra Party's time in government was spent taking a sledgehammer to the old economic order, liberalizing and privatizing to their heart's content. What followed was an unmitigated disaster, as poverty skyrocketed with millions left destitute from the economic shock that followed. Unable to manage this crisis, the Indian people elected a left-wing INC government to quell their financial woes.\n\nGiven their mandate on the promise that they would turn the tide against the torrents of privatizations inflicted upon the economy, the incumbent Prime Minister faces a difficult task, to put it mildly. A new class of elites and oligarchs have emerged as the beneficiaries of the Swatantra Party's governance, unwilling to see the current reversed, and more than willing to exert their influence. It remains to be seen as to which of these two forces will prevail."

Without recklessness, without innovation, and without excitement, the INC - Democratic government has only offered ennui to the electorate, who have predictably ousted them from power.\n\nReturning to power, the INC's left-wing has promised to rectify the failures of Desai's experiment in economics with a reinstatement of the Republic's financial orthodoxy. First and foremost, their attention will be dedicated to revitalizing the neglected social welfare systems and then renewing the government's focus on land reform. In due time, the previous government's efforts will exist only in the history books."

Casteism remains widespread especially in territories outside of the former Azad Hind government. Though religious tensions have calmed, watchful eyes look suspiciously at every attempt to secularise the state.\n\nDespite the failure of the Pakistan Movement there still exist lingering tensions in the Northwest, while in the rest of the country the newly integrated IAS is slow to carry out our policies. The old ghosts of communalism will never stop haunting our people until we exorcize them for good - and with every passing day the temptation is greater to burn them out with force."
