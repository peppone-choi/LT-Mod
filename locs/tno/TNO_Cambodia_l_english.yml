 ### Ideas ###
 CAM_Dictatorial_Devaraja: "Dictatorial Devarāja"
 CAM_Dictatorial_Devaraja_desc: "§D"I would not hesitate to take the initiative myself in sacrificing it and orienting the nation toward other roads and assist it to accomplish in peace and without bloodshed the revolution of its choice."§!\n§Y- Norodom Sihanouk, 1962§!\n\nA naive disciple of Buddhism may misunderstand Kingliness or Devarāja as an ordination of absolute monarchy as the natural order. A righteous adherent of Devarāja acts as a conduit for the Buddha's tenets. The House of Norodom, King Sihuanouk in particular, took Devaraja for granted, that their political legitimacy was eternal, growing fat and lazy as their people suffered.\n\nIt is why when Son Ngoc Thanh took it upon himself to purge the royals from their pedestals of power, his popular support reached heights unseen by any monarch. Today, the historical figure Thanh harkens back to for strength and philosophy is Sdech Kan, a brave soldier who overthrew a corrupt and wicked king to restore order to his land. For Thanh, Kan epitomizes Devarāja."
 CAM_The_Unloving_Father: "The Unloving Father"
 CAM_The_Unloving_Father_desc: "§D"Many Thais acted as leaders of the Khmer Serei in helping Cambodia to get rid of France. But even if these people were Thai, they were good Cambodians as well. They loved Cambodia more than the Cambodians themselves."§!\n§Y- Samniant Khanthachawana, 1970§!\n\nThe Republic of Kampuchea was not birthed into this world by its lonesome. It was given shape and form by its father, the Republic of Thailand, a model to aspire to. This relationship is not one of nurture but of knives that the younger Republic must dodge.\n\nThe dual tragedies of losing the regions of Battambang and Siem Reap after the war and the Kampuchean nation's near-cessation in 1949 during Operation Issara have left it as a thrall of Bangkok's wishes. Thankfully, the Thai government has little care for the Khmer people, leaving them to their own devices for now."
 CAM_The_North_South_Axis: "The North-South Axis"
 CAM_The_North_South_Axis_desc: "§D"The Cambodian race is of noble origin. It is not afraid of death when it is a question of fighting the enemy, of saving its religion, of liberating its fatherland. The entire race follows the Buddhist doctrine which places death above slavery and religious persecution."§!\n§Y- Son Ngoc Minh, 1951§!\n\nThe North-South Axis is a vernacular shorthand for the tensions between various Phnom Penh political tribes and the government. On the left, the youth cry out for the territories dismembered from Kampuchea's body by Thailand, a roaring scream demanding that they be returned.\n\nOn the right exists General Lon Nol's amorphous clique, the Kampuchea Krom movement. Their position advocates for increased rights for Khmers living along the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam or an ultranationalist return to eighteenth-century total Kampuchean rule. Luckily for the President, all of these views are dormant currents in the Khmer body politic, if ones that may resurge given time and favorable circumstances."
 CAM_The_Five_Year_Plan: "The Five Year Plan"
 CAM_The_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "§DIf stones have fallen from the building\nSir has them reset in the original position.\nSir Monsieur Commaille, from France,\nTakes cement and paints it on like paper as reinforcement.\nWherever moss grows thick enough to block your view\nSir has it swept out clean.\n§!§Y- Oknya Suttantaprija, 1909§!\n\nIeu Koeus and Son Sann were both given mandates to the President and people, with the Five-Year Plan being their mandate's capstone. The first of its kind in Kampuchea, its goals are total agricultural reform, land redistribution, and mechanized light industry in Kampot and Takeo, two provinces primed to serve as models for the rest of the country.\n\nTo make this plan a reality, the two men have been generously assisted by Japanese financial, managerial, and technical skills, all coming at a high premium in a booming economic cycle."
 CAM_Jewel_Of_The_Republic: "Jewel of the Republic"
 CAM_Jewel_Of_The_Republic_desc: "§DFrom the city to all the provinces.\nEvery stream and creek has a bridge,\nLittle and big, hundreds and thousands of bridges,\nSolid as a rock, cars roar over them\nThousands of elephants can tromp over them\nThey've never broken§!\n§Y- Okna Sann, 1928§!\n\nPhnom Penh is another French colonial experiment, embodying their modernist and avant-garde expressionist tastes and being a testing ground for what would best suit their own cities. The French have since been sent home, and now Japanese and Republican banners cascade its skyline, reclaiming it as one of the premier jewels of Asia.\n\nThe city is a Southeast Asian economic powerhouse, drawing in tourists, gambling, prostitution, and more in a showcase of all that has become modern. Coinciding with this development, Phnom Penh also features a rabidly pro-Thanh intelligentsia and youth circles who view these displays with disgust, proposing solutions to eradicate these deformities of modernity in increasingly radical tones"
 CAM_Spilling_The_Masters_Tea: "Spilling the Master's Tea"
 CAM_Spilling_The_Masters_Tea_desc: "§D"The Vietnamese buried alive the Khmer people up to their necks and used the latter's heads as a stand for a wood stove to boil water for their master's tea. As they burned and suffered, the victims shook their heads. At that moment, the Vietnamese torturers said to them: "Be careful not to spill the master's tea!"§!\n§Y- Livre Noir, 1978§!\n\nA noticeable disquiet with the Vietnamese minority exists in Kampuchea. While the government may put on a front of chauvinism and ethnonationalism, it has maintained a nuanced approach to Khmer-Viet relations and an air of cordiality with the Hue government.\n\nHowever, today's government must tread carefully over a minefield of yesterday's misgivings. If the President is perceived by the Khmer people as aloof or unsuccessful in getting what is seen as just settlements from their Vietnamese partners, these misgivings may boil over to deadly proportions."
 CAM_The_Veal_Thom_War: "The Veal Thom War"
 CAM_The_Veal_Thom_War_desc: "On the northern border between Kampuchea and Laos is a mistake. Prince Norodom Chantaraingsey, whose lines to Tokyo were crucial for the success of Koeuss' rural reforms, took 12,000 men to Stung Treng in order to seize the province from Laos. Chaos followed: Japanese capital fled, the Indochinese Communist Party emerged as a force in the region, and both Laotian troops and Dap Chhuon's reavers have been mobilised.\n\nThis situation is proving itself to be a diplomatic nightmare for Phnom Penh."
 CAM_A_Confused_Revolution: "A Confused Revolution"
 CAM_A_Confused_Revolution_desc: "The ideological basis behind Kampuchea's newfound revolution is... shaky at best. While Son Ngoc Minh and his top cadre are firmly committed to communism, revolutionary principles steeply declining down the ranks.\n\nRather than being a vanguard of the working-class, the Communist Party of Kampuchea is a big tent group of the patriotic and progressive elements within the nation aligned against Japan. For most, independence is good enough, with the matter of what to do about capitalism being left vague as the debate for whether or not it is needed continues due to Kampuchea's backward state."
 CAM_The_Squabbling_Brothers: "The Squabbling Brothers"
 CAM_The_Squabbling_Brothers_desc: "Officially, Kampuchea and Vietnam are now brother nations, united by the fires of socialist revolution. In reality, the relationship between the two is much more nuanced.\n\nChauvinist attitudes toward the Vietnamese have not lessened, with many growing more incensed by their so-called liberator. These feelings are only furthered by rumors of the Vietnamese using their invasion to redraw the border to their liking, annexing disputed villages. Only time will tell whether or not this disdain dies down or grows worse."
 CAM_Traditional_Devaraja: "Traditional Devarāja"
 CAM_Traditional_Devaraja_desc: "The concept of Devarāja has returned from the myths and legends of Sdech Kan back to the established notions of the monarchy. It doesn't matter if Sihanouk himself rejects the royal trappings some of his supporters view him through, to many in Kampuchea, Sihanouk is their monarch. This has led to the interesting dynamic of Phnom Penh's intelligentsia viewing him as their President, while the rural peasantry honors him as their King."
 CAM_Devaraja_Chained: "Devarāja Chained"
 CAM_Devaraja_Chained_desc: "President Son Ngoc Thành has become too much of a liability to Japan and his own government, forcing drastic action to be taken. The once-great soldier is now under house arrest as Kampuchea's government operates under a much more moderate figure, using the President as an instrument of their authority, trotting him out occasionally as an ornament of their power.\n\nHe will remain like this until he dies, whereby someone more suitable will take up his mantle to succeed where he failed."
 CAM_Dictatorial_Devaraja_Lon_Nol: "Dictatorial Devarāja"
 CAM_Dictatorial_Devaraja_Lon_Nol_desc: "History rhymed with Son Ngoc Thành deposing Sihanouk like the old Sdech Kan of the past, but it repeated itself with Lon Nol's own deposal of President Son Ngoc Thành after he failed to preserve the national pride of the Khmer people. The self-proclaimed marshall struts about in martial attire, making grandiose proclamations as the declared guardian of all Khmer people. However, whether or not he lives up to Sdech Kan remains to be seen."
 CAM_Dictatorial_Devaraja_Lon_Non: "Dictatorial Devarāja"
 CAM_Dictatorial_Devaraja_Lon_Non_desc: "Again, history repeats itself, as Lon Non seizes power from his brother. However, this coup was not conducted out of any love for the nation, but a love for power. The Thai gave Lon Non the opportunity — the means to take what he wanted — and he happily accepted.\n\nPeace was not his goal, just a side-effect of his quest for power, but one his backers were satisfied by. As long as he can satisfy the Khmer people with it, then his rule is safe and secure. Otherwise, he may see the same fate as his brother."
 CAM_Republican_Revolution: "Republican Revolution"
 CAM_Republican_Revolution_desc: "In China, the Republican model gleams with excellence, an excellent example of how a modern Asian society should operate. Unfortunately, Kampuchea inherited the Thai imperialist mode of governance, much to their detriment. With Hu Nim's republican revolution, this has now come to an end.\n\nWang Jingwei's revolutionary example will be followed by the Republican Youth, learning from how he broke the back of Anglo imperialism in Asia. His light will forever shine in Kampuchea as long as the revolution remains, guiding them to a standard of politics, and enlightening them with the ways of bringing their nation into the twentieth century."
 CAM_Bubbling_Northern_Tensions: "Bubbling Northern Tensions"
 CAM_Bubbling_Northern_Tensions_desc: "Once, the demands for the return of the territories dismembered from Kampuchea by Thailand were just the rallying cries of a few disparate youths centered in Phnom Penh. Now that these youths are the ones running Kampuchea, their voices have been amplified to the nation's stage. No longer divided by the lost cause of Kampuchea Krom, their attention is focused on the Thai imperialists who will subjugate them no more.\n\nSoon, there will be a reckoning to settle the matter once and for all..."
 CAM_New_Kampuchean_Revolution: "The New Kampuchean Revolution"
 CAM_New_Kampuchean_Revolution_desc: "A beautiful new dawn has begun for Kampuchea, the start of great national rebirth. For too long, President Son Ngoc Thành's visions of the future have been compromised by the futile act of compromise, sacrificing everything to get nothing. With the declaration of martial law, this has changed.\n\nIt is Thành's way, or the highway, as the government begins the process of Khmerizing the economy. Foreign businesses unlucky enough not to be Japanese are all at risk unless they show enough loyalty to the Khmer nation, much to the worry of Kampuchea's neighbors, looking for a way to neutralize this issue."
 CAM_The_Managerial_State: "The Managerial State"
 CAM_The_Managerial_State_desc: "Kampuchea's reconstruction will be a long and tiresome process, and without any notable politicians left standing, Japan has been forced to turn to the civil service core to stabilize the nation. Empowered far beyond their normal remit, these apolitical mandarins are tasked with planning Kampuchea's recovery.\n\nWithout any resources available, they will likely be forced to turn to Japan for financial support, whereby Japan will eventually become Kampuchea's new manager."
 CAM_The_Second_Five_Year_Plan: "The Second Five Year Plan"
 CAM_The_Second_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "Under the guidance of Prime Minister Pach Chhoeun and Son Sann, a new Five-Year Plan has been devised after the success of the previous one. The model of agricultural reform, land redistribution, and the construction of mechanized land industry will be expanded to the provinces of Kampong Spieu, Kandal, Prey Veng, and Svay Rieng. Japan will generously loan the resources needed to make this place a reality as another round of modernizations are carried out in Kampuchea."
 CAM_The_Third_Five_Year_Plan: "The Third Five Year Plan"
 CAM_The_Third_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "As the influence of Kampuchea's political left grows, a new five-year plan has been designed, with this one being the most ambitious yet. Its architects, Khieu Samphan and Ea Sichau, have expanded the trials of the six provinces in the previous two plans to cover the entire country.\n\nInequality will be no more, the peasants will own the land they toil, and the Khmers will be more unified than ever. While this will have to be paid with Japanese loans again, soon will come a day when they won't have to, when Kampuchea can stand up on its two legs without any shackles."
 CAM_Expansionist_Pariah: "Expansionist Pariah"
 CAM_Expansionist_Pariah_desc: "Lon Nol's flagrantly ethnonationalist and revanchist rhetoric in speeches appear so egregiously, it makes previous President Son Ngoc Thành's handling of the topic seem positively dovish.\n\nAgain and again, he hammers on the topic of Kampuchea Krom, that severed limb of the nation and the Khmer Krom besieged by the Vietnamese tyrants. With the Republic's military amassing on the Thai and Vietnamese borders, his neighbors believe that something must be done to rid themselves of this nuisance."

 ## Ministers ##
 CAM_Ieu_Koeus_hog_desc: "§YPrime Minister of the Republic of Kampuchea\nLeft-Wing Corporatism§!\n--------------\n§LIf Son Ngoc Thanh is the heart, Ieu Koeus is the brain. Already a respected politician and leader in the National Assembly during Sihanouk's reign, successful negotiations during the end of Issara confirmed his reputation as an elder statesman of the new Kampuchean republic. In certain circles, high and learned, Koeus' expertise in governance has earned him esteem higher than that of Thanh himself.\n\nNow in his second term in office, Koeus busies himself with bringing prosperity to his country. Immersed in economic and industrial reports, with credit statements from Japanese and Chinese banks mixed in the pile, Koeus prepares a new five-year economic plan for the Kampuchean nation.§!"
 CAM_Son_Sann_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nCorporatism§!\n--------------\n§LThey say it's not surprising that Son Sann knows money—as the son of a wealthy landowner and with a degree from the Hautes Études Commerciales, he was born into wealth and grew to understand it. He distinguished himself as a civil servant in the Issara years, and proved himself a worthy enough bureaucrat to join a new cabinet as Minister of Finance.\n\nBut beyond his own financial acumen, he is the link between Kampuchea and Tokyo. This is his greatest strength to Son Ngoc Thanh's government. Were it not for his connections, Kampuchea would not have the capital to afford both the particular needs of the five-year plan and the general reconstruction of the nation following Operation Issara.§!"
 CAM_Achar_Sok_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nSocial Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LBefore 1947, Achar Sok was a humble monk, teaching the sacred language of Pali at Unnalom. Known for his sensitivity towards the plight of the poor, he saw in Son Ngoc Thanh and his rise to power an opportunity to redress that plight. Sok traded his kasaya for a suit and joined the new KRPA, coming to represent in Thanh's cabinet the 'left wing' of the big tent.\n\nEven as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sok remains concerned with efforts to redistribute wealth towards the poor, with rhetoric that borders on socialist. If Japan is concerned about this, they are certainly tense about his vision for foreign policy, as Sok's eyes drift away from Vietnam and Thailand, towards Indonesia and Azad Hind.§!"
 CAM_Dap_Chhuon_sec_desc: "§YDirector of National Security\nWarlordism§!\n--------------\n§LThere are days in Son Ngoc Thanh's cabinet where the seat for the Minister of Defence is empty. Its owner is in Siem Reap, convalescing along the banks of the Tonlé Sap. Perhaps it is best that the seat lies empty, for when it is occupied, death follows.\n\nDap Chhuon maintains his nom de guerre because no other name fits him. Chuan Kemphet does not, for he left that name in the Franco-Thai War. It was Dap Chhuon who returned, who descended from anti-French rebel leader to petty warlord, ruling atop a charnel throne. In Thanh's eyes, men of such brutality are necessary to maintain order, no matter the infrequency of his presence—or the mountains of corpses his work leaves behind.§!"

 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_SON_NGOC_THANH_DESC: "In 1949, Prime Minister Son Ngoc Thanh walked into Phnom Penh, smashed King Sihanouk's throne to pieces and declared the foundation of the Republic of Kampuchea. Such an outcome was the inevitable resolution of his many contradictions: a republican serving a king, a Khmer nationalist educated in France, an admirer of Japanese governance in a kingdom built by the French. He had risen to the position of Foreign Minister by Tokyo's assent, harnessed the boundless energy of youthful radicals to secure the Prime Minister's office, and seized on the Issaran chaos to finally break the Throne of Norodom.\n\nThe modern-day Sdech Kan governs with both widespread popular support and an iron fist smashing upon dissent. With the state now in his control, Thanh seeks to build up its capability, dragging it out of royal decay and into a bright new future. Yet the compromises demanded by Issara's end gave rise to forces opposed to him. Moderate voices and leftist agitators continue to orbit the politics of Phnom Penh, calling for new rule in Kampuchea.\n\nIn time, they will know the depths of his displeasure."
 POLITICS_SON_NGOC_THANH_CORP_DESC: "Once upon a time, Thành was the hero, the legend who destroyed Norodom decadence. Now, he lounges in obscurity as "President", a title as meaningless as "King". Sometimes, he wonders if Sihanouk is laughing at him beyond the grave.\n\nIn his isolation, he has been given plenty of time to reflect, allowing him to pinpoint the exact moment of his downfall. It all started with Lon Nol and the right, ever since he gave them an in with the Prime Minister post. Of course, that didn't satisfy the left — it never would — but he didn't expect them to leave the KRPA, and he certainly didn't expect them to take arms against him.\n\nAusterity! It was the only word they knew — no surprise that the peasants grew out of control and the agrarian crisis turned bloody. If it wasn't bad enough that the leftists were in arms, then that damned Prince and his "Free Khmer" forces had to join the fray; he should have killed all of those royals when he had the chance. And then, they all came down on Phnom Penh.\n\nThey won... at the cost of their national pride. That bean counter Son Sann and the other Japanese bootlickers cried to Tokyo for help, as if Thành couldn't hold out, and put him under arrest. Now, he sits at home, waiting for the odd ceremony for them to trot him out until they get tired of him. He has become what he hated: an idle and useless king."
 POLITICS_SON_NGOC_THANH_REVNAT_DESC: "For too long, Son Ngoc Thành was forced to bow down to the petty ideals of compromise. No more. His Kampuchea will be one of his pure vision, like undriven snow, untouched by Laotian, Thai, or Vietnamese machinations.\n\nRightist Thai lapdogs like Lon Nol and Yem Sambaur nip at his heels, their murder of Pach Chhoeun being the latest instance of this, but their day will come. His power has only grown over the last decade, unmatched by any wastrel king, ready to strike down all who oppose him once and for all. When that day comes, none of them will see it coming.\n\nThe leftists, however, have proved their worth to him. Despite their tendencies, they have shown themselves to be true patriots. Men like Khieu Samphan — the next generation of national revolutionaries — willing to carry Kampuchea to its new era of power. They will build the Republic to its next level of greatness on the bodies of those Laotian, Thai, and Vietnamese traitors.\n\nA sea of Khmers look towards him in awe, their beloved President. Each one of them is a warrior, each one willing to die for him, all without hesitation. Thành looks on with tears in his eyes, proud to have been one to have given the nation back its pride... the man who inspired the next generation to reclaim the empire stolen from them."
 POLITICS_SON_NGOC_THANH_MANSTATE_DESC: "Compromise is the great killer of dreams. Thành thought he had broken free from it when he declared martial law but was only drawn into another one as the pawn of the Vietnamese. Now, it has made him into a rightist puppet of Yem Sambaur.\n\nSitting alone in his home — guarded by Lon Nol's men — the President in name only has been given plenty of time to reflect on his mistakes. He believes the downfall began when the failures of the Veal Thom War ripped Stung Treng from his arms again. Of course, that mistake goes back to Operation Issara. If only he never gave in to wretched Laotian demands and Japanese meddling.\n\nLike a lame dog, he was forced to beg for help, turning to the Vietnamese for help. With them, it was all take and no give, something he was too blind to see. When Keng Vannsak called him a traitor to the Khmer nation, he realized he was too far gone. Maybe this fate as a puppet is just for a wretch like him, even if he belongs to a dog like Yem Sambaur.\n\nAnd what is the grand realization of this epiphany? That he was a fool to rely on others. He was a coward forsaking his Khmer pride to lean on those lesser nations, content to betray and abandon him when he was no longer needed. Thành only hopes a real hero will come to power in Kampuchea and show the vermin what the Khmer people are really made of."
 POLITICS_NORODOM_SIHANOUK_DESC: "Twenty-one years. That's how long Sihanouk has waited to exact his revenge against the man who toppled him from his throne; that's how long it took to make Kampuchea his again.\n\nAn only child to royalty, he was made Kampuchea's king by the French at the tender age of nineteen following the death of his grandfather, Sisowath Monivong. However, Sihanouk's honeymoon period was brief, ending when Thành forced himself into the position of Prime Minister. A glutton for power, he smashed Sihanouk's throne to pieces, winning over the fawning masses.\n\nExiled to the political wilderness, Sihanouk spent his time making allies amongst the others who fell out of Thành's favor. His break came during the civil war, allowing him to attach himself to the anti-Thành political right, joining with Prince Norodom Chantaraingsey's "Free Khmer" forces. Sihanouk soon overtook the Prince in popularity, becoming the movement's new figurehead.\n\nYet his endgame is not that of a powerless face, nor is it that of the monarchy's restoration. No, Sihanouk has adapted to the times, learning the modern ways of control. It is he who the Kampuchean people owe their stability to, he who heroically ended the civil war while the coward Thành ran away, and he who will shape the Kampuchea of tomorrow — tailored to his image."
 POLITICS_LON_NOL_DESC: "President Son Ngoc Thành was once promised to be the man who would guide the Khmer nation to greatness, but as time went on, it became clear he was just a Vietnamese puppet. History repeats itself as Lon Nol has been forced to overthrow a lazy ruler to lead the nation.\n\nThe son of a "peacekeeper", Nol took after the family tradition as an enforcer for those in power, even if it was to uphold French colonial rule. When the Japanese delivered independence to them, he quickly ingratiated himself with their regime. When the Republic was declared, Nol stomached the loss of the King, soldiering on for the Khmer nation as he ascended the military ranks.\n\nRising to control Kampuchea's armed forces at the start of the sixties, Nol continued the difficult task of rebuilding their prestige following their humiliation in Operation Issara. However, his progress was undone by Thành's kowtowing to the Vietnamese, abandoning the Khmer Krom for political power. Given a chance by the President's trip to Tokyo, he struck and took power.\n\nNow President, he plans a change of attitudes. No more will they conceal their desires for the return of their territories. No more will the Khmer sit down out of fear of spilling the Vietnamese's tea. No more kneeling.\n\nKhmers stand up!"
 POLITICS_LON_NON_DESC: "Khmers had their time of standing up, much to the discontent of their neighbors. Lon Non's ascension to power indicates the Khmers will be sitting back down, returning to holding the master's tea. Perhaps, this status quo is better for them.\n\nBut who is Lon Non? Apart from being the brother of Lon Nol and his overwhelming desire for power, most would be at a loss to give him a description. However, these two characteristics have made up a significant part of his life up until now. He followed his brother into the military, ascending the ranks thanks to nepotism and an unfailing willingness to please.\n\nWhen Lon Nol became President, Lon Non benefited immensely and became one of the most high-ranking figures just by being the President's brother. However, his hunger for power would not end there, as Thai interest groups reached out to him, looking for someone more controllable to take power. Using them, his own power base, and dissident politicians, Non seized control.\n\nWhen it comes to ruling, President Lon Non deals with the concerns of the Thai and Vietnamese first and then domestic matters. Beyond maintaining stability, his goals are unknown, even to himself, as a set ideology beyond power seems alien to prescribe to him. So long as he can maintain it by whatever means necessary, then all is well."
 POLITICS_SIM_VAR_DESC: "In Sim Var's office, past the bullet-ridden and blood-streaked walls, a list of orders is being written up by the new President. They go from his office down to the ranks of the other civil servants, detailing how to pick up the pieces of their broken country. He wishes he was anywhere else.\n\nWhile Var always had his ambitions, he never expected to go from the farm to Kampuchea's highest office, but fate is funny. Fate brought his fellow nationalist, Son Ngoc Thành, to power. It didn't matter that there were many like him, Sim Var included, but he was the one who was tapped for greatness. Initially bitter, Var accepted this, joining the KRPA to assist his friend.\n\nThành repaid his friend's long service to the cause of Kampuchean nationalism by gifting him the cozy position of Kampuchea's ambassador to Japan. Mixing this job with his roles in the civil service, Var would become well-acquainted with the Japanese as he spent more and more time in Tokyo, the city he was in negotiating for aid when news came in that Phnom Penh had fallen to the Viet Minh.\n\nWhen Var returned home following Japan's liberation of his nation, little was left. With most, if not all, other high-ranking government officials having been executed, he was finally given his opportunity for power by fate, even if he no longer cared for it. But someone has to rebuild Kampuchea; it's just unfortunate that someone is himself."
 POLITICS_HU_NIM_DESC: "In 1949, Son Ngoc Thành dethroned the slothful Sihanouk and ushered in a republican revolution for Kampuchea. Unfortunately, only the first part of this statement is true. That was until Hu Nim and his men marched into Phnom Penh as victors twenty-one years later.\n\nBorn in extreme poverty, Nim was allowed to escape his peasant fate through education. Thành's abolishment of the monarchy proved to be the catalyst for his involvement in politics, but his road to Damascus moment came when he was allowed to study in Nanjing. There, he learned of revolutionaries Wang Jingwei and Lin Baisheng, what it meant to truly be a republican.\n\nAs he navigated Kampuchea's leftist political circles, he ascended the ranks of the KRPA, serving in Achar Sok's ill-fated government. When Thành turned to the right, he resigned, unwilling to participate in the austerity and neglect of the countryside. Soon, resignation turned to resistance, as he and other disaffected youths took up arms against the failed republic.\n\nCarried into office by his zealous Republican Youth, President Hu Nim's future is... unique. Domestically, Kampuchea's land will be returned to the people who have toiled it for so long. Internationally, he marvels at China as the guiding light of Pan-Asianism, one that may even overtake Japan. Nationally, he looks to Thailand's stolen lands... with unfettered fury."
 POLITICS_SON_NGOC_MINH_DESC: "In Kampuchea, no other man quite as dedicated to the idea of revolution as Son Ngoc Minh exists. When he dreams, he doesn't picture the empty rhetoric of those before him, he imagines a truly proletarian revolution where his nation is free from all forms of imperialism.\n\nBorn to a Khmer Krom father and a Vietnamese mother, Phạm Văn Hua was once destined for the humble life of a Buddhist lay preacher until he was persuaded to the path of revolution by the Viet Minh. Adopting his nom de guerre by mixing the names of Son Ngoc Thành and Hồ Chí Minh, he followed the lessons of the latter, finding the former's nationalist rhetoric unappealing.\n\nAfter setting out on his path, Minh did his utmost to hasten the Republic's downfall, causing significant chaos with Viet Minh insurgents during the Veal Thom War. Outside of Kampuchea, he helped destabilize the Vietnam regime, softening it up for the Viet Minh's final offensive to topple the collaborators. He would repeat this feat in Kampuchea as Vietnam took to the offense.\n\nInstalled into Kampuchea's highest office, Indochina's future appears bright as an empire's shackles are finally released. However, there remains the risk that Japan will return, unwilling to tolerate such acts taking place in their backyard. If they return, Minh will go underground again, armed with enough tricks to make Japan's continued control a nightmare."
