 #TOOLTIPS
 SC_info_tt: "§WThe §YSubcontinental Crisis§! has become the latest flashpoint of the rapidly heating §YCold War§!. Both sides have strong reasons not to let the §BIndian Subcontinent§! stay in the hands of the other, and it is their ability to skillfully master brinkmanship that will decide its, and even §fAsia§! itself's ultimate fate.\n\nEach side's §OReadiness§! forms the primary element of the crisis. §OReadiness§! is the measure of each side's willingness and capability to defend their interests and stand their ground. Towards §Y100%§!, it means they will never yield to aggression; should it reach §Y0%§!, they will §Pblink§!, retreating with cold feet over the possibility of §xnuclear war§!.\n\nOnly our own side's §OReadiness§! is always known to us. Our opponent's §OReadiness§! is kept secret behind the Cold War's §Lfog-of-war§!. This is represented by §jUncertainty§! on our opponent's §OReadiness§! bar, an area where their last estimated §OReadiness§! could be. Decisions can steadily §juncover§! it.\n\nBoth sides must try to raise their §OReadiness§! as high as possible, and should things come to a head they must also try to lower their opponent's §OReadiness§! as much as possible. Certain decisions are more effective depending on what our opponent's §OReadiness§! is. Above §Y80%§! lies the §xRed Zone§!, in here, we can rest assured that we will never back down. §xThe same goes for the enemy§!.\n\nThere are many ways this crisis can end. Either we or our hated opponent can be forced to §Pblink§! by reducing §OReadiness§! to §Y0%§!, leaving the other side completely victorious.\n\nBut this cannot go on forever. At some point into the crisis, the timer will start ticking, and we will reach the §YBreaking Point§!. If both sides are evenly matched or have a §OReadiness§! below 30%, the Crisis will freeze and result in a stalemate. Otherwise, the side with the lowest §OReadiness§! will immediately §Pback down§! as if their §OReadiness§! hit §Yzero§!.\n§RThat is, unless we are §xboth§! stuck in the §xRed Zone...§!§!§!"

 subcontinentalcrisis.53.t: "Reinforce Pakistan"
 subcontinentalcrisis.53.d: "The great steel behemoths of the Kriegsmarine swept through the boiling waters of the Arabian Sea, hulking forms cutting sharp white wakes through the waves. Against the deep blue of the ocean stood, in stark contrast, the jet black of their superstructures - painted in blatant defiance of tactical norms. With its runway marked by a single giant swastika, jutting defiantly into the seafoam, the carrier Adolf Hitler led the group in V-formation - flanked on one end by the cruiser Friedrich Barbarossa and the destroyers Emden, Wotan, and Erich Koellner, and on the other end by the cruiser Generaladmiral Warzecha and the destroyers Eisenfaust, Hochmut, and Erich Giese. Lurking deep beneath were six U-boats - all bearing arms that could obliterate the entire subcontinent they made for. The German navy, once bound to the memory of a broken Reich, had returned to the seas.\n\nOn the docks of Karachi Port, amidst the ambient low drone, beeping of alarms, and thousands of voices shouting, lay a deep sense of unease. The dockworkers that had seen a hundred vessels arrive and a thousand leave had also heard the rumours. That the Germans were coming not as friends, but as new conquerors. That the movement that had liberated them from Delhi's tyranny only sought to replace it with their own. And, for those few that had listened to the whispers from across the border- that when, not if, the Japanese had had enough, Karachi would be the first place burned into oblivion under the scorching rays of the Rising Sun.\n\nDeep beneath Wünsdorf, in the sterile white operations room of the OKW, Großadmiral Erich Topp watched with grim determination as aides with long staves pushed small scale icons of their ships across a giant map of the Arabian Sea. Across the peninsula of the Indian Subcontinent, in the Bay of Bengal, red markers denoting the approximate positions of the Imperial Navy saw far less movement. A single submarine flotilla, last thought to be near Sri Lanka, had not been touched in hours."
 subcontinentalcrisis.53.a: "Let them come. We earned our place in the sun, and we will keep it."
 subcontinentalcrisis.100.t: "From East to West"
 subcontinentalcrisis.100.d: "Havildar Agarwal sensed a vague unease in the barracks air, felt it seep through his skin and chill his nerves. He had enjoyed garrison work in Odisha—he spent his days drinking and playing cards, grabbing a bit of ass that passed by, and beating down a few suspicious persons every now and then. His own superiors had given up on his squad's efficiency, just as their superiors had given up on them, and as long as Agarwal could occasionally look scary and ran a drill once a week, Odisha would continue to be burdened by his presence.\n\nThen came rumours, falling soft like snow. Trouble in the north-west. Agitation from Germany, riling up Muslims. Pakistan was hundreds of kilometres away, and Agarwal didn't think much of it—whatever the problem was, the boys in Rajasthan and Gujarat could deal with it. More rumours: resistance down in the old Republic, people getting used to Bose on their walls and radio. He tried to keep cool, but his eyes that had once always fallen east towards the beautiful coast kept turning to the northwest.\n\nThen it happened, almost all at once: the night before, Agarwal and the rest of the garrison were called back to base, effective immediately. There would be a briefing at 0500, attendance mandatory. Reveille came an hour early; Agarwal's squad was jolted out of bed and into their uniforms by an electric dread.\n\nA captain gave three-quarters of the garrison their marching orders: north-west to Punjab. Agarwal's men were included, and they knew they were being pushed out as dead weight. But some of the other faces he saw loaded onto trucks and cars surprised him. They were dedicated, golden boys trapped in the garrison. All over India, garrisons were shedding off their best and their worst, and sending them to the border."
 subcontinentalcrisis.100.a: "Someone had lit a match, and there was tinder all along the border."
 subcontinentalcrisis.101.t: "Go West, Young Man"
 subcontinentalcrisis.101.d: "Captain Adil Lal ignored the grumbling, the discontent, the rumours and innuendo that followed their western advance. He was possessed by the fiery delusions of ambitious and righteous youth. No matter what he did, he knew he was right, and he feared no harm would befall him so long as he willed himself to follow what he knew was right.\n\nWhat was wrong was the continued occupation of his home land, the division of his family between arbitrary borders. Somewhere west, he heard his mother in Lahore calling to him. Somewhere east, he heard his father in Amritsar urging him onwards. It pained Adil to hear it; it emboldened Captain Lal to take steps that were unsanctioned. Scouting, probing at the thin barrier between India and Pakistan, and finally, advancing west.\n\nCocooned in their trucks, his soldiers made it barely ten metres into enemy territory when his vanguard reported the sounds of jet engines. He told the men to ready their arms and continue. There was a brief hesitation, then they continued along the path. This was meant to be a simple raiding party, but just before they crossed the border, Lal's ambitions got in the way. Scouts had reported a forward operating base north of a rail station. They were going to seize it, push their supply further into the Lahore city limits, establish an early foothold so that a siege of the city would be contained to its borders.\n\nThey made it another two hundred metres before the jet engines drew closer. By the time the company noticed it, jet engines gave way to loud rotors, gull wings and Jericho trumpets, with the crescent and star painted over a swastika. The company had little anti-air capability on hand, and a single Stuka bombing run took out the front third of the convoy. Captain Lal tried to rally, ordering them to pull over and assume defensive positions before a swift pistol butt to the back of his head silenced him. Some of his men fought back; the rest just pulled over and laced their fingers behind their head."
 subcontinentalcrisis.101.a: "Awaiting the consequences of someone else's actions."
 subcontinentalcrisis.102.t: "ATTN: FÜHRER - INDIA-PAKISTAN CONFLICT"
 subcontinentalcrisis.102.d: "TOP SECRET\nEYES ONLY\nTO ALL MEMBERS OF THE [getGermanIntelAgencyCaps]\nUNTERNEHMEN SCHRAUBENZIEGE\n\nPAKISTAN - SOUTH ASIA - MEMBER OF THE EINHEITSPAKT\n\nIndian National Army forces have been spotted attempting to cross the border into Pakistan. Only one incursion has been recorded at this time, though both India and Pakistan are preparing to declare war in light of this violation of sovereignty. As Pakistan is critical for expanding Reich interests in Asia, it is vital that we support them in repelling any potential Indian invasion.\n\n     1. Prior to the incursion, Indian troops were moved away from garrisons in former Republican territory (see p. 4) and towards the Pakistani border. This has been corroborated by both signal interception (see Appendix A.5) and asset reports (see Appendix A.8-11). This suggests an intent to invade prior to the incursion.\n     2. We have reason to believe that the initial incursion was not sanctioned by the Indian National Army (see pg. 8-9). Disseminating knowledge of this will help bolster the strength of Pakistan's claims and potentially demoralise Indian troops.\n     3. Diplomatic correspondence shows Pakistan regards India in its current state as an existential threat (see Appendix B.3). While a diplomatic solution is possible, current intelligence suggests that both sides are preparing for an armed conflict. To protect our interests in the region, we must ensure Pakistan survives.\n     4. German military assets have already been placed on standby, as per orders from regional commanders (see pg. 11-12). As per the terms of our agreement with all member nations, the Reich will be obligated to mobilise if Pakistan opts to declare war on India. So long as Azad Hind is a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in good standing, this will result in war between Germany and Japan...\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."
 subcontinentalcrisis.102.a: "Received by the Foreign Ministry, 11:58pm GST."
 subcontinentalcrisis.103.t: "ATTN: PM - INDIA-PAKISTAN CONFLICT"
 subcontinentalcrisis.103.d: "DAIHONEI TOKUMUSOUKANBU\nREPORT #[?global.date.GetDateStringNoHour]-03\nTOP SECRET\n\nA division of the Indian National Army has attempted to cross the border into Pakistan, heightening conflicts in the region. The incursion was repelled by Pakistani forces, with their commander MIA. Both Pakistan and India will use this incident to justify a declaration of war. It is the opinion of the Tokumusoukanbu that while India must be supported, care must be taken if we are considering war.\n\n     1. Following the pacification of territories formerly under the Nehruvian government (see p. 3), the Indian National Army deployed additional forces from garrisons to the Pakistani border. This has raised tension between the two governments, though analysis of the acts suggest that it was intended primarily as a defensive measure by Indian high command.\n     2. The incursion by Captain Adil Lal was not sanctioned by the Indian National Army (see pg. 5-6, Appendix A.2). While Captain Lal is currently MIA (presumed dead), the remnants of his unit have been folded into other divisions. Asset reports suggest that hawks within the Indian military have privately praised his initiative.\n     3. The ethnic and religious tensions between India and Pakistan are seen as irreconcilable by both parties claiming the disputed territory currently held by Pakistan, contributing to a mutual desire for armed conflict. A diplomatic solution may be possible, though currently unlikely.\n     4. India is a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and Japan is obligated to support it in military activity following a formal declaration of war. Pakistan is also a member of the Einheitspakt, and Germany has already pledged to support its defense if required. While it is in our interests for India to win a war against Pakistan, we must also ensure that Germany is not involved. Pages 11-15 outline a potential strategy for forcing Germany to remove Pakistan from the Einheitspakt..."
 subcontinentalcrisis.103.a: "Received by the Foreign Ministry, 11:58pm JST."
 subcontinentalcrisis_has_started: "The Subcontinental Crisis has begun."
 subcontinentalcrisis.110.t: "Accession"
 subcontinentalcrisis.110.d: ""This tyranny of barbarians, lined up at the gates, trying their utmost to sully a sovereign and independent people are attempting a folly..." The other representatives at the Permanent Council of the Unity Pact felt as if Jahanara Shahnawaz had been speaking for hours on end, others merely stifled laughs at her faux-aristocratic accent.\n\n"...attempting to browbeat a proud people of noble and distinct origins into accepting a dictatorship run by savages. Do they have any shame at all?" A chorus uttered a weary no. "Of course not. They prance about like bandits, forgetting the education bequeathed unto them by the British, preferring to wallow in poverty than admit they are worse off after independence."\n\n"We in Pakistan have not forgotten the gifts we inherited from Britain, and we will not give them away to join a madman's crusade against the imagined evils of this world." The representatives collectively murmured in agreement; the sovereignty of Pakistan had been attained, and it's place in the Pakt was assured."\n\n"The people of Pakistan know that they have more in common with the people of Europe than the Indians menacing us at our borders." Another murmur, as some considered how the crisis would set back German-Japanese relations. It would take a long time for them to recover, even if the price was arguably worth it."
 subcontinentalcrisis.110.a: "So long as World War Three wasn't the price for Pakistan."
 subcontinentalcrisis.111.t: "Peace Through Superior Firepower"
 subcontinentalcrisis.111.d: ""Well, quite frankly, it's incredible." A junior analyst at Mitsubishi studied the most recent chart of weapon sales to India as his manager peered over his shoulder. "After the crisis, we had previously forecast a lull in these sales, but it seems the opposite has happened here."\n\n"You shouldn't be so surprised. For them, the war hasn't ended." The manager was an old hand at this, having first started during Japan's first armament for war, and then helping to oversee his nation keep the peace during those precarious post-war years as they shepherded its younger siblings out of colonialism.\n\n"But the borders have been drawn? Not even Bose is suicidal enough now to try and invade a fully-fledged member of the Pakt, so why the extra arms imports?"\n\n"It's a cold war, like the one we have with the West." He paused, considering the appropriate language to use, before giving up and proceeding anyway. "Think of it as a pissing contest. Each of them will man their borders, dressed up with the finest equipment money can buy, with scarcely any bullets fired. It's theater, amusement for the top brass."\n\n"I see." It all seemed remarkably pointless for him on a personal level, the sort of thing that would make his head hurt if he tried to think about it for too long, yet he persisted with another question. "But don't you think they'll give up eventually? That peace has to come eventually?"\n\n"The war on the subcontinent has killed millions; everyone there has a grudge against someone else. Even as generations pass, these grudges will only be inherited. You can rest assured...""
 subcontinentalcrisis.111.a: "...the money will stay flowing as long as the hate does."
 subcontinentalcrisis.120.t: "A European Community"
 subcontinentalcrisis.120.d: "When Ewald first got to Pakistan, he was sent to provide technical and training support for the Pakistani military, an order from high command. He couldn't disobey it, even if he'd rather be in Moskowien training the troglodyte Slavs, or even the Judeo-Bolshevik partisans. Yet, he obeyed, even if he gnashed his teeth on the flight there. And he continued to obey when he arrived.\n\nGradually, something changed. The ragtag platoon of Pakistani boys who flaunted the title of "Aryan" became something more than that. Growing from timid beings used to only firing warning shots, they became cold-hearted killers in no time. Fear was swiftly replaced with hate, unafraid to gun down the invaders on the other side mercilessly.\n\nEwald knew he wasn't experiencing an isolated case, as the Pakistani forces gained the upper hand. By the time the Japanese forced India to surrender, he had called it weeks ago. And with that, it was time to leave.\n\n"Thank you for everything, brother." Iqbal, one of the whelps he was leaving his command to called out to him. "I hope you will come back here sometime. Business is sure to be booming soon, brother." Ewald smiled. Maybe, retirement here wouldn't be such a bad idea; he could easily live like a king.\n\n"The pleasure was mine. If you were with us when the Russians first tried their tricks in the fifties, we could have crushed those communists for good." The smile was returned before Ewald clambered into a jeep to leave. A final guard of honor was prepared for him, as his platoon performed the Führer salute perfectly. A part of him wished he could stay forever."
 subcontinentalcrisis.120.a: "Pakistan belongs to Europe."
 subcontinentalcrisis.121.t: "They're German Planes, Made In Germany"
 subcontinentalcrisis.121.d: "Pravin was born in a Gazipur slum. He died in a trench on the Pakistan frontier, sharing a cigarette with his platoon. Sleep-starved, he only dimly heard the Luftwaffe jets buzzing overhead, and he craned his neck to see the bomb hit the ammo dump sixty feet away. Before long Pravin and the position were nothing but ash.\n\nThe story was the same down the line. On Iwakuro Hideo's desk, reports of supply depots and logistical centers hit, fortified redoubts softened up from the air. Even Japanese intel positions thought totally secure had been under fire. The ambassador rubbed his forehead wearily. On the front, multiple IJA advisors had sent missives warning that the Indian army was in total chaos; soldiers were exhausted after the fight with the Delhi government, morale was low and army intelligence had been almost certainly compromised. There was little operational capacity to defend India's territorial integrity - even if Japan could ensure victory at sea, any further escalation would only end in disaster.\n\nSo Iwakuro drafted a report of his own. A clear message to Tokyo: Japan had no choice but to back down."

 subcontinentalcrisis.130.t: "Pulling Back"
 subcontinentalcrisis.130.d: "The German general gaveled the emergency session of the Military Commission of the Einheitspakt in as soon as everyone but the Pakistanis—who had not been invited—was present. No Pakistani flag was present; there was not even a seat left open for them.\n\nNot allowing anyone a word in edgewise, the general intoned the decision of the Military Commission on the future fate of Pakistan:\n\n"In my position as Chairman of the Military Commission of the Einheitspakt, I hereby declare:\n\ni) that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is ruled unable to meet its contributions to the Einheitspakt;\n\nii) that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is therefore ruled in default of its obligations and is hereby expelled from the Einheitspakt;\n\niii) that all protections afforded to Pakistan by Pakt members are, with immediate effect, null and void."\n\nRepresentatives of other Pakt countries joined together in a clump after the meeting was adjourned. Their feelings were the same that day, no matter their usual strategic alignments. Fear was poorly hidden amidst the slight talk that governed so much of day-to-day diplomacy.\n\n"The Germans have kind of ...'lost it', haven't they. This all seems rather erratic for them, doesn't it?"\n\n"Yeah! Not a year ago they were welcoming Pakistan to this exact council, and now for fear of the Japanese and their Sphere the Pakistanis have been kicked out."\n\n"My thoughts exactly. I'm worried; what does this mean for us? If some other threats come knocking—""

 subcontinentalcrisis.131.t: "The Fall Of Jammu"
 subcontinentalcrisis.131.d: "Private Mahsud watched the open horizon with equal parts boredom and terror. He held the Gewehr in his hands limply, as if afraid that to hold it any tighter would result in the gun going off. He felt relatively safe in the pillbox, confident that its thick concrete walls would protect him against small arms. It did not protect him from the knife that plunged into his back—his breath was driven out of his body, and Corporal Bayya pushed his corpse out of the way. He opened the gate and saw more of his comrades emerging from the horizon.\n\nSergeant Razavi tried to hide his nerves. Command was meant to radio back ten minutes ago, and they had otherwise been so punctual. Even a minute's radio silence was concerning. He turned to his men and was about to call for a return to base when one of his riflemen went down, his skull shattering like a vase. Corporal Khera watched through his binoculars the last second of his bloody descent to the earth. Sergeant Yamada pulled back the bolt of his Arisaka rifle. Another patrolman went down, clutching his neck. Yamada urged Khera to prioritise his targets. "Don't get creative on the battlefield," he said, picking off another private; this shot caught him in the thigh. "When you see a man with authority, target him first." He pulled back the bolt again, and through the scope saw Sergeant Razavi's panic.\n\nCaptain Gardezi heard the rattling of bombing runs from enemy aircraft, yet he insisted on keeping the air control tower locked down. He and his men had been successful; through the gunsmoke he could see down a hallway littered with the first failed wave. Two cylinders soared through the darkness, over the sandbags and office furniture. The men panicked, but Gardezi pulled them aside with calm confidence. He knew it was just smoke. Yet obscured by the smoke and the panic, two grenades rolled gently through their defenses. Gardezi and his men had no time to react—those who were not knocked out by the concussive force of the impact were cut up by shrapnel. Captain Pandey led the advance team, his rifle roaring with victory as it struck down the defenders of this lone tower."

 subcontinentalcrisis.140.d: "It may not have arrived yet, but it was in the post — the end was coming for Pakistan and the rest of the world.\n\n[PAK.GetLeader] could not stand any longer; his body collapsed into a Victorian chair. This was not what they wanted, but this — an impending annihilation — was what they got. They were pawns, fools for German dominion. He realized that now, even if it was far too late to matter, too late to do anything but weep .\n\nWhere he was once royalty who ruled his land with impunity, Yusuf was just one of the masses seeking a last desperate flight to anywhere. He was a man unaccustomed to the word "no" until today. Money could not buy him what he wanted — survival — so, for once, he was a pauper like everyone else at the airport.\n\nThere was once a cause he understood, perhaps it still remained buried within him vaguely, a flicker that kept Hamza fighting for Pakistan. Time melted away as days turned to weeks, all trapped on the same battlefield, fighting for... something. The enemy fought for something as well, blocked out of Hamza's mind until he saw the white of their eyes. Then, he understood.\n\nThe land had been tilled for weeks, and yet, nothing for Muhammad. It felt appropriate; everything else was a struggle too. Pakistan was a struggle, something he almost died fighting for, something he gave everything for. The radio buzzed, chiming in with news. He listened attentively, before dropping his shovel on the ground, before falling himself to his knees.\n\nIn Karachi, a mother hugs her child for the final time.\n\nA minute later, they are evaporated by the white light."

 subcontinentalcrisis.141.t: "Maneuvers"
 subcontinentalcrisis.141.d: "Not far off the Sri Lankan coast, the IJN flotilla and the Kriegsmarine lurched towards each other like floating steel traps. Petty Officer Kusumoto braced himself against the hanger wall of the Shinano, troubled by uneasy dreams of dying sakura trees.\n\nHe heard people crying out, and then the sickly tropical air was cut apart by fighter jets above. Somewhere in the distance was the violent thump of the first barrage. In the control tower, a phone clicked back into the receiver.\n\nKusumoto had needed the dark, but as he squinted against the light of day, great plumes of smoke rose from the German fleet, and every armament swung into iron-wrought life. Light cruisers flanking the carrier roared ahead, whipping up the sea into a frenzy. Absently, Kusumoto felt the heat of an aircraft gaining speed on the deck beside him.\n\nFar away, a seaman from Bayern spoke a desperate prayer, before the hull ruptured and tore his throat apart. Six friends from the naval academy in Etajima began to drown together. Ships were going down all over; the Teutoburg and the Thule blew apart and warped in the inferno raging on the water’s surface. Kusumoto flinched away as a German jet roared in close, its guns turning the men on the flight deck to red mist in front of him. Awoken from his dream, his heart raced in vain to make peace with death. In the Shinano’s last moments afloat, the violent ocean was suffocated with sakura leaves.\n\nIn fifteen minutes, hundreds were dead. The death toll continued to climb. It was the greatest battle in naval history, and perhaps the last."

 subcontinentalcrisis.142.d: "Lines drawn on a map, movements of men, scattered across Subhas Chandra Bose's desk. There were millions of permutations, but nothing that would spare him.\n\nWaves subsume tiny atolls in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn a perfect world, none of this would exist — he would not have needed to exist — but their world was far from perfect. Their lines were already drawn for them, but soon, each line would be a fading memory.\n\nFires engulf flora and fauna without distinction.\n\nThere were... mistakes, sacrifices made in the name of a free India. Working under a Western power, then an Eastern power, and then letting both powers collide.\n\nA first strike hits Karachi, ending a million lives instantly.\n\nJewish refugees stopped at his borders, handshakes with Hitler, countless memories that straddled the line between necessity and evil. He wasn't sure if the same applied to Pakistan — whether their liberation was legitimate or not — but such matters were trivial now.\n\nA battle for meters of land ends in a stalemate, both sides losing to nuclear armageddon.\n\nThe sights outside his window reminded him why he fought, gazing over them for a final time before a bright flash overwhelmed it, a blinding light.\n\nThe glass shattered, as Kali Yuga consumed the visionary."
