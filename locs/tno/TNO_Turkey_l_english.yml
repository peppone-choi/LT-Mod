 ##Leader Bios##

 POLITICS_ISMET_INONU_DESC: "If Mustafa Kemal was the father of the Turks, then Ismet Inönü is their Godfather. What could suffice, to describe the life of the man whose very whims have defined the policies of nations, armies, and empires?\n\nBorn to a Kurdish father in Smyrna in the year 1884, and faced with the weight of an empire collapsing all around him, Inönü served the Ottoman army with distinction in Yemen, in Rumelia, and under Mustafa Kemal himself in the war of liberation against the old empires of Europe. Ismet was a man truly committed to seeing the Turkish nation rise restored from the ashes of the caliphate, and quickly rose through the ranks of the new revolutionary guard until he was no less than Atatürk's own right hand.\n\nTensions had always existed between Kemal's strident pragmatism and Ismet's uncompromising will, and burst into sparks on numerous occasions in the past. Today, with the days of the Ghazi confined merely to memory, many claim that the old Vizier has overstepped his limits. That he had sold the nation to her enemies, that he had turned it against the very principles it was founded on. But those claims were nothing; Nothing save for insults to the very legacy of Atatürk.\n\nIn his long tenure as President of the Turkish republic, Ismet Inönü has pursued a single aim with a single mind: the survival of the Turkish state that he had helped found from nothing. When the State's interests called for détente with the Fascists, he had followed them. When they demanded the jackboot and the butt of the rifle, he heeded them. Through the great trials of the past three decades, he marched on: Battered and bloodied and slandered - but never beaten.\n\nThe state that stands today is a testament to the man's political ability and above all to his uncompromising will. A great Turkish state: one that will remain great, no matter the cost."
 POLITICS_CEVDET_SUNAY_JUNTA_DESC: "Cevdet Sunay has spent most of his life in the military. Born in 1899, he served in the Ottoman army in World War I, briefly spending time as a British POW, fought for Turkey’s independence on his return, and steadily rose through the ranks since - a rise that reached its pinnacle in 1960 when he became Chief of the General Staff.\n\nVenerable and well respected, he was the ideal figure to act as a figurehead for the young officers who overthrew the civilian government. He was also not overly forced into the role, as - though he has little interest in the minutiae of politics - he believes that the Turkish military has a duty to protect the nation from demagoguery and radicalism. The duty of the junta, in his eyes, is to stabilize the situation so that reasonable civilian governance can resume as soon as possible; it's his duty to get the rest of the National Unity Committee to fulfil this promise."
 POLITICS_CEVDET_SUNAY_DEM_DESC: "Cevdet Sunay has spent most of his life in the military. He has little interest in the minutiae of politics. Unfortunately for him, that seems to be all there is. With the National Unity Committee disbanded and handing the reins of power to a civilian government made up of Turkey’s most qualified politicians, Now, self-appointed President Sunay would ideally be able to spend his time unbothered in Çankaya Mansion, but each day there seems more fires to put out, and it would a dereliction of duty if Sunay stood idly by and let his work come to nothing.\n\nThe President does what he can to prop up the Erim government, to preserve the dream of a democratic, modern, Kemalist republic. Sunay is being asked to do his job - to fight for Turkey, as he has always done."
 POLITICS_CEVDET_SUNAY_INTERIM_DESC: "Cevdet Sunay has spent most of his life in the military. He served in the Ottoman army in World War I and has participated in every conflict Turkey faced since. Sunay knows what defeat looks like.\n\nThe Erim government has collapsed after the National Assembly fought itself into a deadlock, the streets see more angry marchers every day, and the economy is beggared by inflation and a lack of confidence. The recovery plan has failed, and President Sunay can do nothing else but act as Çankaya Mansion’s caretaker until the conclusion of new elections. Ever the pragmatist, when he agreed to back the military coup, when he helped devise the return to civilian governance with the rest of the National Unity Committee, he knew there was a good chance that these efforts would fail.\n\nBut it was different when it was just a lingering possibility. In the cold light of day, it’s different."
 POLITICS_TEVFIK_RUSTU_ARAS_DESC: "Born in Çanakkale on February 11th 1883, Tevfik Rüştü Aras was one of the the young, west-facing urban professionals of his generation who joined the Committee for Unity and Progress. He put aside his medical practice to fight in the Great War and in the Independence War, where his friendship with Mustafa Kemal helped propel him to prominence.\n\nFrom 1925, Aras would serve well as Foreign Minister for Atatürk; his tall, slender frame, round spectacles, and bedside manner made him surprisingly effective diplomat. However, as fascism’s rise in Europe endangered Aras’ agenda of regional alliances and Soviet rapprochement, and his rival İnönü’s rise to President a concern closer to home, Aras saw the writing on the wall. When he resigned from the CHP and Foreign Ministry on the eve of Turkey’s entrance into the Axis powers, a new chapter of the doctor’s life began.\n\nDespite the urgings of Peker to stay, who hated the alliance himself, he was seen as a potential rival by President İnönü, and as a communist sympathizer for his pro-Soviet views, his career in the CHP came to an ignoble end. In the following years, the doctor who had once been at the heart of the one-party dictatorship became one of its more notable critics, advocating democratization in the press and being minorly connected to Celal Bayar’s short-lived DP. In the late fifties, President İnönü came knocking again, and invited Aras to form an opposition party. With the help of Ekrem Alican of the Human Rights Society, the DYP was formed as a party of the broad left, and would eventually take a more socialist character when Mehmet Ali Aybar took party leadership with trade union support.\n\nAras has been on both sides of power, and is evidently qualified to become Turkey’s third President. Some smear him as a red, but as long as he can wrangle Alican and Aybar, Aras might be able to finish the work Atatürk started."
 POLITICS_FUAT_KOPRULU_DESC: "In the past, when stagnation and decay were synonymous with the Ottoman Empire, the Grand Viziers of the Köprülü dynasty were fires of dynamism that kept it alive as long as possible. Now, as Turkey experiences the Ottoman ailments, another Köprülü takes the reins.\n\nFuat Köprülü entered public life as a teacher of Ottoman Turkish before being born again during the Balkan Wars as a Turkish nationalist. An intellectual, his days were spent mired in academia, leading to Atatürk appointing him to a post in the Ministry of Education. There, he would impress the President enough to ask Fuat to enter the Assembly.\n\nHowever, Köprülü would become dissatisfied with the autocratic CHP regime as the Pekerite plague took hold of it, forming the UDP with Menderes and Bayar. They hounded the dying dictatorship at each step, fuelled by center-right fury, unbroken even by Bayar's murder. With a nation in embarrassment, the UDP finally seized the levers of power.\n\nEntering power, the UDP may have been disunited on aims, but one matter they were united on was who to lead them: Fuat Köprülü. The white crescent sinks low on a dead wind, but the new President is replete with resolve. True democracy will come to Turkey, and the nation will forever be one, united and unstoppable."
 POLITICS_TEKIN_ARIBURUN_POSTJUNTA_DESC: "“We will not accept any regime other than a democratic regime.”\n\nAfter the technocratic government under Nihat Erim had collapsed, the army arrived — as it is known to do. Instead of heralding a perpetual state of emergency, however, the soldiers brought reforms with them.\n\nTekin Arıburun is one of those soldiers of democracy. Born on October 16, 1903, in Shtip, Arıburun is the son of a Gallipoli hero who carried on the family mantle. Rising through the ranks of the Air Force, he became Turkey’s first air attaché and a decorated commander. His leadership and political reliability were especially notable during the Italo-Turkish War before he eventually transitioned into politics.\n\nWhen elected President by the Assembly, the old hero proved to be a stabilizing force while Özal’s Patriotic Unity Party implemented sweeping economic reforms. Despite his military background, Arıburun is a firm supporter of civilian governance — true to the Kemalist ideals his uniform represents."
 POLITICS_OSMAN_TURAN_DESC: "A court scholar for the modern age, Osman Turan is one of Turkey’s preeminent medievalists and an expert in Seljuk history. That this rather reserved academic now sits in the presidential Çankaya Mansion is thanks in major part to another historian-turned-statesman, Fuat Köprülü.\n\n Having discovered the young Turan at the University of Ankara back in the late 1930’s. Köprülü oversaw Turan’s PhD. After Turan’s academic career was interrupted by the war and stifled by the Peker dictatorship, the restless professor would follow his mentor into oppositional politics and into the UDP, representing his hometown of Trabzon in the Assembly.\n\n Despite his dry manner, Professor Turan’s scholarly and political life, including his chairmanship of the cultural society Türk Ocakları, his prolific writing, even his marriage to an Ottoman princess, have helped establish him as a straightforward and respected figure in conservative-nationalist circles; who better than a historian to help Turkey learn from its past?"
 POLITICS_SEVKET_SUREYYA_AYDEMIR_DESC: "A glance at Şevket Süreyya Aydemir could invoke many feelings in a Turk’s mind. Thoughts the CHP allow to formulate in the now enlightened worker, the minds of visionaries and patriots. Thoughts that defile the legacy of heroes, of progress, of the truth as it has been ascribed at every turn. Searching for water has become tiresome at the calm and open sea, rippling nothing more than afterthoughts. \n\nThe nation is now Aydemir’s to steer. At every waking moment, socialism will be drilled into each facet of the workers, crevices upon their hearts from the Six Arrows tugging them forwards. Dreams of tomorrow’s Turkey weigh heavy in his mind, a burden he will not carry alone for long."

 TUR_economic_stagnation:0 "Economic Stagnation"
 TUR_economic_stagnation_desc:0 "Failed German projects in the Mediterranean and along the Euphrates have seriously damaged our economy after a period of prosperity. To complicate the recovery, German and Italian companies are less and less willing to invest in Turkey, the former due to its ever-worsening political and economic situation, the latter due to our precarious alliance: reforms are needed, and quickly, or the Turkish economy might fall even harder should a crisis arise.."
 TUR_spoils_of_war: "Spoils of War"
 TUR_spoils_of_war_desc: "A war was waged, and a war was won. Now, Turkey grows fat and gluttonous with new opportunities as the realms of demand and trade seem more vibrant than ever. The military complex roars in delight at the new territories that need to be administered by the men of war who must be equipped.\n\nThese are our golden days, but nothing good lasts forever, it may be wise to prepare in case our star ever begins to fall from its ascension..."
 TUR_year_of_grief: "The Year of Grief"
 TUR_year_of_grief_desc: "The Turkish people fought like lions but were led by donkeys. The Second Italo-Turkish War was a failure of the highest order for Turkey, not just in its execution but also in its aftermath. Its toll has led to rising prices, rising inflation, and rapidly decreasing living standards.\n\nThe old order is on the brink of collapse as it becomes subsumed by political chaos, with opposition parties thriving on their failures. For the average Turkish citizen, there are no such opportunities, only a grim situation they must endure."
 TUR_italo_turkish_tension:0 "Italo-Turkish Tension"
 TUR_italo_turkish_tension_desc:0 "The Triumvirate is on its deathbed, and the "loving" relatives are mostly cheering for the agony to end. With relationships between Turkey and its former Italian ally at an all-times low, several nationalist politicians have resurrected the old Turkish claims to the Levant, Cyprus, Rhodes and Thessaly, in the hope of bolstering national morale - and their own popularity.\n\nDespite this nationalistic revival, there are many who express worry, or outright fear, for the potential consequences of such claims. Italy is - after all - the most powerful country in the Mediterranean, and despite its overstretched forces, there is no guarantee that they won't find the strength to fight..."
 TUR_inspectorate_generals: "The Inspectorate Generals"
 TUR_inspectorate_generals_desc: "The Inspectorate-Generals are government commissions answer only to the President of the Republic; tasked with pacification of tumultuous regions and extending Turkification policies to the lands under jurisdiction of Inspectorate-Generals, specifically in the eastern regions. After the Second World War, two new Inspectorate-Generals established in northern parts of Syria and most recently in northern Iraq; the latter enjoys greater autonomy due to being a more recent addition to the republic. Even though officially these Inspectorate-Generals are being praised for their stabilizing effort; both local populaces and a significant portion of political establishment in Ankara are opposing their what they see as an oppression.\n\nWith the unrest and dissent rising across all provinces under Inspectorate-Generals, it is becoming clear that a change is needed- and even then, it is not clear whether this change will be for better, or for worse..."
 TUR_stains_of_the_past: "Stains of the Past"
 TUR_stains_of_the_past_desc: "Recep Peker, without a question, has been the most influential leader ever since Atatürk himself. He fundamentally changed the Republic and the CHP, molding them in his ideals of a vanguard party state that would expand Kemalist values across Anatolia. Now, more then ten years after his death, his policies still hold strongly to the roots of the nation, standing against the forces of reaction and revolution.\n\nNo matter what, his idealist reforms hasn’t got himself any love from the Turkish public, and with the CHP being seen as his party - a party of cold authoritarian bureacurats - they face doom at the hands of a democratic fervor. The CHP must reflect on its past and move to the future if it wishes to save its fate from that of the history books."
 TUR_demokrasi_bahari: "Demokrasi Baharı"
 TUR_demokrasi_bahari_desc: "The veto of the 1962 Democratization Bill by the BKK, co-proposed by the DYP and the UDP with the aim of ending the illiberal election laws and voter suppression in the country, has shaken the nation to its core. The Turkish people are fed up with the supposed democratization of the country, and they demand real reform on the streets of İstanbul, Ankara, and more.\n\nThis marks the biggest mass protest in the nation’s history, with the protestors ranging from students who dream of a freer Turkey to farmers who want economic aid. The regime in Ankara is seen as the repressors of popular will, fit only for removal. One way or another, this challenge to the government's authority must be dealt with."
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki: "Demokrasi İttifakı"
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_desc: "The ‘Demokrasi İttifakı’, or Democratic Alliance, was a pact made between the UDP and DYP during the 1963 election to put their differences aside and work together against the CHP dictatorship and bring democracy to Turkey. This was a simpler arrangement while the two parties were in opposition, but will likely be harder to manage various diverse ideologies and viewpoints now they find themselves shoulder to shoulder in government. People wait and see if the Alliance can work together to dismantle the one-party state the CHP made."
 #CHP
 TUR_divide_and_conquer_idea: "Divide and Conquer"
 TUR_divide_and_conquer_idea_desc: "The election season of 1963 has come and gone, and the people of Turkey have freely reaffirmed their faith in the party of Atatürk and İnönü by giving us a plurality in the Assembly. This democratic expression has proven too much for the ‘Democratic Alliance’ to bear, with the bitterly-divided UDP and DYP unable to form a government despite a technical, razor-thin majority. Instead, negotiations with the DYP have concluded fruitfully, with them won over by Kasım Gülek’s reformist agenda and willing to serve as junior partner in our coalition."
 TUR_a_modern_chp_0: "A Modern CHP - Ambiguous"
 TUR_a_modern_chp_0_desc: "The party communication machine is ablaze with a new phrase, "a modern CHP", but the Turkish people don't know what this exactly means. They are intrigued by calls for a more accessible and accountable party and promises to connect to the people, but this has only led to more questions about what this entails.\n\nIf Gülek and the CHP are to continue their victories, the voters must be freed from the clouds of uncertainty surrounding this "modern CHP"."
 TUR_a_modern_chp_1: "A Modern CHP - Left Leaning"
 TUR_a_modern_chp_1_desc: "The CHP has shifted to the left following the various reforms undertaken by the party. Bülent Ecevit and the current he has created has charted the course for what could be and Left Kemalism is increasingly not only legitimized, but actualized."
 TUR_a_modern_chp_2: "A Modern CHP - Right Leaning"
 TUR_a_modern_chp_2_desc: "The CHP has shifted to the right following the various reforms undertaken by the party. Turhan Feyzioğlu and the current he has created has charted the course for what could be and Right Kemalism is increasingly not only legitimized, but actualized."
 TUR_a_modern_chp_3: "A Modern CHP - Gülek's Vision"
 TUR_a_modern_chp_3_desc: "Maybe in a past era, the CHP could not see a more modern future. Rigid and like a boulder to the wind, the Kemalists of yesterday would continue to toe the line. No more. With Gülek as the president, reforms continue to be passed and succeed. The victories of the parties are his, not Erim’s, not İnönü’s, and not anyone under them who were clinging to their orthodoxy. Ecevit and Feyzioğlu are lockstep behind him promoting only the best for the party and the orthodox wing is satisfied, despite their occasional grumbles."
 #UDP
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_udp: "Demokrasi İttifakı - Monday Morning"
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_udp_desc: "Our young democracy has survived Menderes’ sly machinations, thanks partly due to the efforts of our coalition partners in the DYP, in the street and the Assembly. While the everyday work of government might be a little harder with Aybar and Alican over our shoulder, recent events have proved yet again the importance of pro-democracy forces standing together in moments of crisis.\n\nSo the UDP-DYP alliance remains, though the political landscape has changed since that alliance was first forged, and with inter-party disputes rising to the fore, the question arises how the extant parties might change themselves."
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_bilgic: "The Unlikely Coalition"
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_bilgic_desc: "Prime Minister Bilgiç has secured the mandate for a second term, yet the UDP did not win a majority in the recent elections. The alliance formed between the UDP and DYP in ‘63 held for as long as it could, but the political landscape has changed dramatically. This goes to explain how it’s come about that Bilgiç’s party has formed a coalition with the Left-Kemalists under Bülent Ecevit. Of course, it used to be that this was unthinkable, but Ecevit and Economy Minister Necmettin Erbakan have fairly similar ideas on the economy, with a focus on welfare and industrialisation. If they can work together, the Turkey of the 1970’s will be a fairer, safer, and more modern place. If they can work together."
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_demirel: "The Business of Politics"
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_demirel_desc: "Prime Minister Demirel’s vision for Turkey is a common-sense one, focused on business-friendly development and personal liberty. With the time having come to form a government to carry out that out, and Demirel’s party without a clear majority, it’s similarly common-sense to make a coalition with the most compatible of the other parties. Although there’s little love lost between Demirel and Right-Kemalist Turhan Feyzioğlu of the CGP, nor with Ekrem Alican of the IDP, the three men all understand; money talks. This triumvirate of the political center is the best hope for Turkey to weather the coming decade, and come out of it a real competitor."
 TUR_great_turkey: "Büyük Türkiye"
 TUR_great_turkey_desc: "Economic Minister Süleyman Demirel and Interior Minister Sadettin Bilgiç have big ambitions to not just drag Turkey’s economy out of its slump but to totally reinvigorate it. Their new attitude to the countryside is partly economic and partly social, offering mechanization with one hand and a soft return to traditional values in the other, hoping to repair the damage done to the landlord class by Peker’s land reforms. Elsewhere, new power lines, railroads, highways, factories are constructed - and in the East, the black gold beckons."
 TUR_great_turkey_menderes: "Büyük Türkiye - Sabırsız İnşaatçı"
 TUR_great_turkey_menderes_desc: "Menderes’ economic vision owes a lot to his background as a landowner - and why not, considering the work required to undo the damage Peker did to rural Turkey? Land cultivation, mechanization, and education are the basis for Menderes’ agricultural policies. Meanwhile, the State Economic Enterprises continue to factor heavily into the industrial sector, for Adnan Bey has judged that the time is not yet right for the economic liberalization that some had clamored for."
 TUR_great_turkey_demirel: "Büyük Türkiye - Refah Devleti"
 TUR_great_turkey_demirel_desc: "Now that Demriel is Prime Minister, his trademark economic policies are taking more and more of the forefront in government affairs; Süleyman is doing everything he can to create a modern Turkish economy as the 60’s come to a close, to show the world just how far the nation has come since the bad old days of bloated CHP bureaucracy and Pekerist corporatism. Demriel has also used this as a way to put distance between him and Menderes, whose recklessness impeded the nation’s stability, and with Bilgiç, whose moralism stood in the way of unleashing the full potential of the free market."
 TUR_great_turkey_bilgic: "Büyük Türkiye - Adil Düzen"
 TUR_great_turkey_bilgic_desc: "Sadettin Bilgiç can admit that Demriel’s ‘Büyük Türkiye’ ideas had some potential, but the Prime Minister has curated a group of allies who posit that the national economy doesn’t need further liberalization, but better guidance. The newly-minted Finance Minister Necmettin Erbakan, while supporting private enterprise, supports poverty relief and social welfare rooted in an Islamist tradition, and the undermining of Kemalist control of heavy industry. Erbakan and Bilgiç will prove a nation can develop a modern economy without acting on every avaricious impulse."
 TUR_gilgamesh_against_enkidu: "Gilgamesh Against Enkidu"
 TUR_gilgamesh_against_enkidu_desc: "A man like Adnan Menderes was never likely to quietly leave politics, even after causing a scandal like the Sunday Crisis. Nor would his supporters vanish overnight. Indeed, the spurned Menderes has returned with a new party, the Milletin Demokrasi Partisi, or People's Democracy Party, promising to finish the job he was elected to do back in ‘63 and clean up the ‘rampant corruption’ in politics.\n\nThe split between the UDP and MDP reflects a deeper divide - one between the urban and rural right in Turkey, the division of Anatolia’s spoils between the businessman and the landlord, the West- and East-facing. In the person of Menderes, this contradiction is expressed, and we need to mend this tension if we wish to be finally rid of him."
 TUR_death_of_enkidu: "Death of Enkidu"
 TUR_death_of_enkidu_desc: "Nobody wanted Menderes to die a martyr. With the assassination of the former prime minister, his supporters process their grief, and his critics celebrate their good fortune. There’s an atmosphere of anger and resentment, and conspiracy theories abound. Work must be done to restore the public’s trust; though there was little love lost between Adnan and Ankara, an affront like this cannot go unsolved and unpunished. In time, tempers will fade, though the mystery of Menderes’ killer still remains."
 TUR_will_of_the_people: "Man of the People"
 TUR_will_of_the_people_desc: "Finally, after a long time out in the cold, Adnan Bey finally has the chance to right the wrongs of the old regime, and totally transform Turkish society. It’s the people who have taken Menderes here, and he intends to go forward together. He was elected to liberate the nation, as his hero Atatürk had done, and nothing will stop him in this mission.\n\nMenderes is a natural in front of a crowd. They don’t see his bitterness, his frustration, his racing thoughts. Menderes lived under the punitive gaze of CHP spies for years. If given the opportunity to punish those who had wronged him, it’d be a strong man indeed to turn that down."
 TUR_will_of_the_people_2: "Will of the People"
 TUR_will_of_the_people_2_desc: "The gambit paid off, and Adnan Bey now occupies Çankaya Mansion, ridding himself of the traitor Fuat Köprülü. The army and the Assembly have been put in their place, but since his erstwhile successors Bilgiç and Demriel proved themselves to be wholly driven by wanton ambition, Menderes’ inner circle of trusted allies has shrunk ever further. He has the pleasure, now, to look at his cabinet and see his close friends - Sarol, Koraltan, İleri. This is now Menderes’ government - that is, the people’s government, for Menderes carries in himself the passions and dreams, the unconquerable, patriotic love of the nation.\n\n§eWho can stop him now?§!"
 TUR_will_of_the_people_3: "Will of my People"
 TUR_will_of_the_people_3_desc: "(not implemented)"
 #DYP
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_dyp: "Demokrasi İttifakı - Wind from Left"
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_dyp_desc: "DYP has managed to secure a reelection, proving the sustainability of their left-wing government. This rather-unexpected outcome while shocking people, has also allowed DYP to distance themselves from their coalition partners in UDP and encouraging even more leftist policies. How all of this will progress, however, is left to be seen."
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_aybar: "The Price of Compromise"
 TUR_demokrasi_ittifaki_aybar_desc: "The government of Mehmet Ali Aybar is an unhappy one. The common ground between the coalition of socialists, liberals, and Left-Kemalists is concerningly unstable, with multiple divisions undermining the government's effectiveness. The one uniting factor is a dissatisfaction with the compromise choice for President Naim Talu, a dry and uninteresting bureaucrat who seems to travel the chaotic halls of power almost anonymously."
 TUR_tip_revolution: "The Vengeful Face of Socialism"
 TUR_tip_revolution_desc: "After eight years of compromise, half-measures, and broken promises, Mehmet Ali Aybar’s theory of socialism through the ballot box is facing its ultimate test. Under the advice - or the pressure - of the DYP’s radical wing, Aybar has defied the Assembly and tasked the people to mobilize, to give the government the ability to make truly radical change. Some are calling it the new 1917. The streets thrum with protests, the halls of power are a hotbed of anger, and the military has a careful hand on the trigger."

Within the niche of Turkish Liberalism, two camps have developed - a more left-leaning one working for the establishment of a social welfare state and a more right-leaning one whose priority is to bring Western-style capitalism to Turkey. The junior coalition partners of the UDP can alternatively be a help or hindrance to the naturally moderate Alican as he walks this political tightrope."

Despite having formed a government; the DYP is more of a coalition than a political party.\n\nUnited under the guidance of the President Tevfik Rüştü Aras, the socialists and liberals composing the party have many ideological divergences in terms of ideals. One day, they will stop calling each other "uncle" as in the proverb, but that day hasn't come just yet."

 TUR_turkish_way_to_socialism_desc: "It is one of the ironies of history that Peker’s industrialization program sowed the seeds for the same labor movement that so terrified Peker and his fellow anti-communists. Here in stark relief is one of the contradictions of capitalism, that the conditions of class struggle are necessary for national development, and yet the reality of class struggle is deliberately obscured.\n\nNow, things are different, and the Turkish worker has a real voice in the National Assembly for the first time. The Turkish worker has gone out on the street and shown in the light of day where he stands. The Turkish worker has organized himself, for there is power in a union. Faced with confrontation, the bosses flinched. There’s a million hurdles from here to liberation, and a million directions to go, but in Turkey the worker has stood up."

 TUR_stability_held_at_gunpoint_desc: "Turkey's ruling coalition is only held together by the barrels of the guns pointed at them. A medley of men drawn together by the military, ministers from the IDP, the AP, and the CHP all clash as they pursue their own separate agendas, only united by a scarce few independent ministers and Erim's desperate attempts at unity.\n\nExtremism creeps in from both sides, taking advantage of Turkey's chaos. Those on the right have mobilized under the banner of the Islamist-nationalist MMP, led by former general Alparslan Türkeş. Meanwhile, the left fights on under Kemal Türkler and the socialist TİP. Streetfighting between the two has become commonplace, much to the worry of everyone else.\n\nErim knows his government can hold — it must. If it can't, the military will oblige once again."

If they have to go against the nation's interests — even if they must bring the country to a grinding halt — if it means a chance to be at the government's helm.\n\nTherefore, like any unruly animal, they must be taught obedience or put on a leash."

 TUR_developmentalism_with_erim_touch_desc: "Erim isn't the only guy with big ideas in government, but his boys keep him well-supplied with them. His "smart guys", a collection of technocrats who have attached themselves to him, have devised a model for Turkish economic growth and stability. Chief among these smart guys is Atilla Karaosmanoğlu, an economist fond of the Japanese methods, who has outlined how to resolve Turkey's economic malaise.\n\nRather than statist solutions for statism in of itself, regulations will be liberalized and denationalization to allow Turkish corporations to become more profitable. With these businesses strengthened, they will be worked with to extract resources, build infrastructure, and promote intense industrialization in the West. How to pay for all of this? As the world heats up, more arms will be needed, something Turkey can happily provide..."
 TUR_a_new_political_paradigm: "A New Political Paradigm"
 TUR_a_new_political_paradigm_desc: "Through cunning, dedication, and patience, Erim has done it. He is back at the CHP's helm, guided his party to victory in the elections, and brought stability, security, and economic growth back to Turkey. In the jubilation surrounding his successes, only a minority dares to criticize, particularly regarding the army's role in these triumphs.\n\nThanks to him, the old status quo has returned. CHP loyalists line the bureaucracy once again, working to ensure their party's grip on power in every facet of Turkish society. The six arrows are upright, all kept in their pride of place from subversion, and Atatürk's legacy is intact. While others say liberties have been lost along the way, Erim knows Atatürk still smiles down upon them."
 TUR_turkish_miracle: "The Turkish Miracle"
 TUR_turkish_miracle_desc: "When Erim and his "smart guys" introduced themselves to Turkey's economic landscape, the bureaucratic orthodoxy was aghast with their proposals, but their new developmentalism has truly opened Turkey's trade onto the world stage. Turkish national corporations such as Koç and Sabancı dominate the Turkish market — rapidly expanding into neighboring markets too — funding and investing in new projects with generous state aid backing them.\n\nTurkish business races into a new age, full of promises and excitement, but at what price? Left-wingers and many older CHP politicians complain of the overt influence the recently strengthened corporations possess over the rule of law, the erosion of labor rights being cited as the prime example of this. However, most believe this to be a necessary sacrifice for Turkey's newfound prosperity."
 TUR_our_most_gracious_overseers: "Our Most Gracious Overseers"
 TUR_our_most_gracious_overseers_desc: "After the army's coup, the Turkish military created an organization known as the National Unity Committee, dedicated to overseeing the Republic and protecting it from demagogues and extremists. It quickly gained a reputation for overzealousness in its duty toward guarding the Republic, proactive in neutralizing those deemed threats to Turkey's stability.\n\nLuckily for the current government, the army is fond of Erim for serving their interests. In turn, the army serves the CHP's interests, helping to ever-so-slightly manipulate the odds toward Erim's favor. Turkey's military has now become an unavoidable part of political life in the nation, a pillar unlikely to change anytime soon..."
 TUR_collapsing_political_scenery: "Collapsing Political Scenery"
 TUR_collapsing_political_scenery_desc: "The Erim Government was seen as the representation of a hope against hope that things would recover and a democratic system could at last be restored. Yet here the nation stands, forced to reckon with the fact that the system it once knew has devoured itself.\n\nAll political parties have lost any credibility; all the leading political figures have been tainted by the failures and incompetence in which they were complicit. There can thus be no doubt that the political system has come to the point of collapse. Despite this, new elections are still on the way. The Turkish body politic, desperate for any sort of improvement, has no way of knowing what will come next."
 TUR_caretaker_government: "The Caretaker Government"
 TUR_caretaker_government_desc: "Nihat Erim had but one mandate: to stabilize the country and put an end to the ongoing stagnation. In this he has failed. His efforts to reduce stagnation worsened it. He was not even able to provide results for efforts mandated by the Turkish Armed Forces and the junta. Erim's incompetence made it such that the government was practically dooomed to fail.\n\nIn the absence of a credible, currently-elected replacement, the Prime Minister remains in place to ensure the country still has a government. But it is clear even to many disengaged members of the body politic that the Erim caretaker administration is a mere rubber stamp. So long as the results of the election are not yet known, it is the Assembly and successors to the MBK that pull the strings."
 TUR_a_new_establishment: "A New Establishment"
 TUR_a_new_establishment_desc: "Nihat Erim had one job — to put an end to stagnation and stabilize the country. He failed in this despite the full and enthusiastic support of the Turkish Armed Forces. The country is paralyzed, we need a way out.\n\nIt has become clear that the answer to this chaos is the assumption of power by Engineer Halil Turgut Özal, popularly referred to as the "tonton", forming the Patriotic Party to assume control of the government. The old parties are a disgrace unfit for governance. They are all incompetent, their organizations sclerotic, and their leadership figures distrusted. The nation thus entrusts itself to Prime Minister Özal to secure our way out of this paralysis and continue to develop our country, all in adherence to what Atatürk once wished us to do. Perhaps Özal will be able at long last to fulfil Atatürk's wishes in a way all these good-for-nothing disappointments before him were not."

 TUR_echoes_in_the_barracks_desc: "The purpose of the National Unity Committee (MBK) is to restore political stability and decency so that Turkish democracy is no longer threatened by radicalism and demagoguery. The military is the safeguard of the nation, and in its hour of need, the military has saved it. But while the junta works to keep anti-democratic forces contained, divisions within the MBK continue to fester behind closed doors.\n\nAlthough all members of the armed forces and the committee swear to uphold Kemalist values, it appears what this means is not yet settled. Army General Cemal Madanoğlu leads the faction which pushes for democratization as soon as possible, believing the junta is simply a temporary measure.\n\n His fellow coup planner Brigadier General Alparslan Türkeş and his faction push against this, arguing that democratization too soon would put the nation at risk - although some whisper that the young officer wishes to use the junta to more radically remake the nation than to just hand it back over to the same politicians that failed it before."
 TUR_echoes_in_the_barracks_2: "Echoes in the Barracks"
 TUR_echoes_in_the_barracks_2_desc: "The purpose of the National Unity Committee (MBK) is to save the Turkish nation from itself. Since Turkish democracy was crushed in its infancy by demagogues and radicals, the military had no choice but to step in and safeguard the nation from further damage. In Turkey’s hour of need the armed forces have stepped in, and they must contain the nation’s ills root and stem before there’s any question of handing power back to the same politicians and bureaucrats who brought us to this point.\n\nAll members of the armed forces and the committee swear to uphold Kemalist values, and that means that they must once again fight tooth and nail for the republic. Thankfully Alparslan Türkeş has taken a leading role in stamping out radicalism, quieting the streets, and planning what the next phase of Turkish government will look like. The soldier is the salvation of the Turkish nation."

 TUR_nine_light_doctrine_desc: "The great leader Alparslan Türkeş has iterated on the Six Arrows of Kemalism, which are simply insufficient for the modern Turkic nation. Türkeş’ Nine Lights Doctrine sets out the new pillars on which a new Turkey will be founded. Nationalism and Populism, like in the Six Arrows, instruct that all Turks love their nation, for all Turks are a part of the nation. Social-Mindedness and Freedom espouse that Turkey should have a mixed economy with the state in control of key industries, and a society of free individuals benefiting from social security and equal opportunity.\n\nIdealism and Morality are key for the development of Turkish consciousness, for the Turk to understand his place in history and culture, while also following the light a scientific mentality can bring to analyse the world clearly.\n\nFinally, in the new Turkey, the peasantry should be cared for and organised into cooperatives to become more prosperous, while the cities should rapidly industrialize, so that the whole nation embraces modernity, the age of the atom. The Başbuğ has decreed."
 TUR_a_new_system: "A New System"
 TUR_a_new_system_desc: "General Türkeş has long known what needs to be done in order to protect the Republic and its institutions—the exalted legacy of Atatürk, the sole hope of the Turkish people. Türkeş has argued for a very long time that nationalists across the country must unite and adhere to policy prescriptions set by him. Now he has an opportunity to do so, and he has taken it with both hands.\n\nThis is where the Milli Birlik Partisi—National Unity Party—comes in. Its aim is to unite Kemalists and Islamists in affirming "Ne mutlu Türk'üm diyene", how happy is the one who calls me a Turk. However, not everybody sees it the same way. Many Kemalists, clearly brainwashed by the socialists and liberals with whom they have become co-conspirators, oppose the efforts of the General. But there is no need to worry. With the Turkish Armed Forces firmly aligned with government, it is too late for these opposition figures to do anything."

 TUR_inonu_and_his_devil_desc: "Power has its price, and for İnönü, the price has been very high. To remain in power, the President has postponed the incoming elections at the cost of a deal with the devil. Falih Rıfkı Atay, a man who was once destined for great things before being cast away by İnönü during his democratization process in the fifties, has returned to hold the reins of Turkey once again — sending İnönü's ambitions back to square one.\n\nChairman Atay is now the country's Prime Minister, the country's government, and the country's ruler. His control over the nation grows daily, wrapped around the levers of power like vines. However, President İnönü still holds onto the slim chance that he can beat the devil and get back both his soul and the country from spiraling into hell. An almost impossible task, but when he has nothing else to lose, there's no point in not trying."

These generals have been wooed over to the Democratic Alliance — careerist politicians emblematic of the sickness we must excise from Turkey — who have set up a separate rogue government in İstanbul. Every day this parallel state exists is another day our authority is questioned — a malignancy we can't afford to ignore.\n\nThe generals will only recognize force, therefore, force will be our only response. They and their phony democracy will be crushed into the earth, eradicated so that not even martyrs remain. The Turkish people will understand, eventually."
 TUR_second_turkish_revolution: "The Second Turkish Revolution"
 TUR_second_turkish_revolution_desc: "Atatürk’s revolutions were undone by the man's death. There exists a need for a second Atatürk, a second Turkish Revolution to continue his great work. Enter Falih Rıfkı Atay.\n\nWithout the revolution's completion, democratization is a hollow process that would only lead to power-hungry demagogues and opportunists taking over Turkey, rendering the sacrifice of countless patriots a sham. This will not be the case; further measures will be necessary. The revolution must be finished in its entirety — no more of İnönü's half-measures.\n\nEvery bigot, every reactionary, and every other piece of scum will be purged from the nation. Only then may Atatürk’s ideals be realized, and only then can his secular liberal democracy be established."
 TUR_the_archdevil: "The Archdevil"
 TUR_the_archdevil_desc: "For many of the Turks, Atay’s Presidency is one where they are stripped of their rights and liberties, and forced to admit complete loyalty to Falih Rıfkı Atay, the successor of Atatürk, İnönü, and Peker. Turkey is now an authoritarian police state, where any thought but Kemalism with Peker’s interpretation is not permitted. Long gone is the era of democratization, replaced with the non-stop progress of Radical Kemalism, under Atay’s watchful eye."
 TUR_task: "Task"
 TUR_task_desc: "In Peker’s words, you cannot plant an orange tree on the Zigana mountain. The only cure for the Turkish people’s bigotry and backwardness is turning them into industrious workers, who would read Atatürk’s words and thoughts directly, leaving their superstitions behind. That’s why, through experienced minister Avcıoğlu’s plans for rapid industrialization, we will succeed in our task. He might be a socialist at heart, but he will surely learn to adapt to the corporatist environment we have."
 TUR_cadre: "Cadre"
 TUR_cadre_desc: "Atay is not alone in his fight against reaction and bigotry. His trusted men and women submit total loyalty to him. Yet among them, like any other institution, is rivalry. Radical Kemalism was born out of the merger of the socialist Kadro thought and nationalist Ülkü thought, both agreeing that Kemalism is the correct way but disagreeing on the end goal. Kadroists want to use Kemalism to transition to a socialist mode of production, while Ülkü wants to keep the state corporatist and militarist. The Ülküist Talat Aydemir commands the force of the Kemalist Youth, and Kadroist Doğan Avcıoğlu dictates the Turkish economy. While Atay lives, no one can challenge his authority, but like others before he’s a mortal, and he will not have a succession crisis."
 TUR_tool: "Tool"
 TUR_tool_desc: "To succeed in our task, we need all working hands of the Turkish people in employment. The Turkish state will mine, drill and process every natural resource, and hand them to the new factories opening up everywhere across our country.

 TUR_second_turkish_revolution_yon: "The Second Turkish Revolution - Yön's Way"
 TUR_second_turkish_revolution_yon_desc: "Atatürk’s revolution was championed by idiots and sycophants that mindlessly repeated his mantras without understanding what they meant, inventing their own meanings to justify their craven ways. Turkey calls out for a scholar to teach them what Kemalism means — what it needs to be — and there exists no better man to carry on the Second Turkish Revolution than Doğan Avcıoğlu.\n\nFascist regimes have despoiled the old Western powers, but the insights of the East, the insights of Atatürk, allows for true socialism to be achieved in Turkey. Kemalism provided the way, and even if self-serving politicians like İnönü were content to lead the people astray, Avcıoğlu could not.\n\nWhile he may be an idealist, he knows the revolution will not be finished overnight, that the transition to socialism takes time. Luckily, the tools of propaganda have illuminated the optimal methods of educating the people. From there, it will only be a matter of time before Atatürk’s dream is realized."

 TUR_second_turkish_revolution_ulku_desc: ""I firmly believe that there will be a second revolution in this country. A hierarchical intervention would be the least harmful!"\n\nThe words of Talat Aydemir — the onetime President of the Kemalist Youth Movement turned leader of the Second Turkish Revolution — may have once been dismissed as idle talk, but now they have become the reality by which Turkey is governed. Radical transformation calls for radical methods, and the heavy industrialization needed to make Turkey a superpower will not come from the petty bickering of the masses.\n\nA disciplined vanguard of Radical Kemalists is required to shepherd the people, to guide them from tumultuous transitions to the promised land foretold by Atatürk. They will decide the means to these ends, unfettered by moralism or doubt, willing to use whatever force is required. They know their children will thank them for it."
 TUR_director: "Director"
 TUR_director_desc: "A director is an artist, forced to order those below them as if they were implements used to paint a canvas, a vision for what an ideal nation should look like. This is what Doğan Avcıoğlu has become, the Pharaoh of an all-encompassing Turkish bureaucracy he will use to drive the fires of industrial development to new levels, his vehicle for the creation of a new — a better — Turkish society.\n\nAnd like any true artist, Avcıoğlu knows that masterpieces are not created by committees, but by a lone figure. Atatürk knew this when he acted as Turkey's guide during its formative years, and now, it is time for Avcıoğlu to do the same as he turns Turkey into a nation that matches Atatürk's vision. İnönü's amateurishness and adolescent fits have been expunged from Turkey thoroughly, the future will be ushered in with watchful eyes, directing every last movement until the final cut."
 TUR_chairman: "Chairman"
 TUR_chairman_desc: "The head of the board only needs to answer to himself. He receives all of the glory and of the fault for the decisions that come from him and from below him. Talat Aydemir has become intimately familiar with this responsibility as the latest shepherd of the Second Turkish Revolution, taking in the spotlight for the decision of his cadre, and overruling them when their iron resolve momentarily descends into tedious debate.\n\nAydemir presents these decisions to the public in the pomp and celebration that a hero deserves. The Turkish people look to him as a model to aspire to — their new man — the man they want their kids to be. Newspapers and media tell a similar story, featuring his face adorning the front pages, extolling his heroism as an equal to Atatürk. Turkey places their trust in him as their national avatar, their voice, and their arm to destroy all those who dare threaten them."
 TUR_a_new_tsk: "A New TSK"
 TUR_a_new_tsk_desc: "Seyfi Kurtbek marched on Ankara with his vision, and today finds himself in Ankara for a much different reason: Heading Turkey’s presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Alliance which he heads has given Radical Kemalist generals a choice: resign and retire in peace, or be forced out with all it entails. Neutral generals continue at their posts, their commitment to the republic ensured. So where does the TSK find itself now? In its rightful place, subordinate to the Ministry of National Defense, as far from political power as possible."

As just as our cause may be, we suffer for the struggle we carried. The economy is a smoldering mess, held up by nothing but words and half-promises. Neighbor is pitted against neighbor on every issue imaginable as polarization entrenches itself. To top all of that off, there is no real means to legitimize our government as foreign powers look down at us as failing.\n\nNo more. With the people at our backs, a proper and true democracy will rise from the ashes and set us free from the ruin."
 TUR_a_constitution_for_democracy: "A Constitution for Democracy"
 TUR_a_constitution_for_democracy_desc: "Turkey rises from the Turkish Revolution of Democracy a nation in crisis, not one of disorder, but of a broken identity. Picking up the pieces and putting them together requires only the brightest and the best to rise to the occasion.\n\nMoving forward, we need to forever leave the one-party rule behind. Their time has been over for far too long, and we should have known that the regime would not be willing to accept that their time had passed. That mistake can not be repeated again. The people need a government they can trust, a Turkey that holds on to the idea of democracy, of a freedom they can truly celebrate. With our greatest minds at work to make a constitution, we will include them every step of the way."

The end of the war sealed all chances of any career in the Navy. Instead, he earned prominent postings as an ambassador to Turkey's allied states.\nA veteran of the Triumvirate's paradoxical procedures and present ever since its founding under Inonu and Mussolini, Korutürk's appointment as Prime Minister has reoriented Turkey's vision outwards, towards its dubious allies.§!"

A nationalist and life-long civil servant, he was instrumental in shaping the modern Turkish economy; This has made the Minister of the Economy a polarizing figure to say the least, with criticism from both the left and the right:\n criticism which has only strengthened his faith in the thought of Mustafa Kemal, and tempered his nationalism into a dogmatic orthodoxy.§!"

Celebrated by a large portion of the public, the opposition parties have claimed it as their success, while more reluctant elements in the CHP have refused to comment.

Bringing American-style politics with a focus on grassroots campaigning, his strategy seems to have resonated with the Turkish public.\n\nGülek’s political agenda consists of leaving authoritarian one-party era policies behind, and amending the constitution with new rights and guarantees, while protecting Kemalist ideals of laicism and nationalism, all in the name of adapting the CHP to the democratic climate.

Although the orthodox wing of the party has lost much of its influence, sharper contrast is being drawn within the once-united reformist clade, specifically between the more left-wing reformers led by Labor Minister Bülent Ecevit and the more right-wing reformers who rally behind Interior Minister Turhan Feyzioğlu.\n"
